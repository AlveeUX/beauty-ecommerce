> Working name of the design brand: **COSMIA** ("Skincare & Cosmetics"). Whether this is the client's real brand is an open question (OQ-01).

---

## 1. Document control

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Define what the e-commerce platform (customer storefront + administration dashboard) must do, based on inspected evidence. |
| Scope | Storefront and admin dashboard. Local development only for the current phase. |
| Version | 0.1 (draft for approval) |
| Status | Approved to proceed 2026-10-19 (P0-P4 delivered; see section 16). Open questions use provisional defaults — see `decision-log.md` D-004. P1 foundation code exists; no storefront/admin features yet. |
| Last updated | 2026-10-19 |
| Companion documents | `context.md`, `development-plan.md`, `e2e-testing-strategy.md` |

### 1.1 Evidence and assumptions policy

Every material statement carries one of these tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Verified (V)** | Seen directly in the Figma file via MCP (metadata, screenshot, or design context) or in the repository. |
| **Proposed (P)** | Recommendation that needs approval. |
| **Assumption (A)** | Temporarily assumed so planning can proceed; must be confirmed. |
| **Open question (OQ)** | Needs a business or architecture decision. Listed in section 14. |
| **Not applicable (N/A)** | Justified as out of scope. |

A feature being drawn in Figma does **not** make it MVP. Priorities (MUST / SHOULD / COULD / WON'T-for-now) reflect business value, dependency and risk.

### 1.2 Evidence base (what was actually inspected)

| Source | Finding | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| Repository `C:\Projects\beauty-ecommerce` | **At discovery time:** empty directory, not a Git repository. *(Since P1: scaffold added. Since D-046: Git repo with GitHub remote `AlveeUX/beauty-ecommerce`.)* | V |
| Local toolchain | Node v24.18.0, npm 11.16.0, Python 3.14.5. `pnpm` not installed. | V |
| Figma file `sXBQCd1Az2To21ejk56Yjc` ("Ecommerce (Copy)") | One page ("Page 1", node `0:1`) with **60 top-level frames**: 58 at 1920 px wide, `3:42651` at 1940 px, `3:42576` at 4275 px. | V |
| Figma MCP | `get_metadata`, `get_screenshot`, `get_variable_defs`, `get_design_context` all responded. `get_variable_defs` on `3:42576` returned `{}` (no variables on that frame). Raw metadata for the whole page was ~3.2 MB, so inspection was done incrementally. | V |
| Figma content | **No** admin-dashboard frames, **no** mobile/tablet frames, **no** account-dashboard / order-history frame, **no** order-confirmation frame, **no** prototype/interaction data was retrieved. | V (absence in inspected metadata) |

**Inspection limits:** screenshots were reviewed for Home (`3:2290`), Shop left sidebar (`3:4833`), Details default (`3:12708`), Checkout (`3:22268`) and frames `3:42651`, `3:41609`, `3:42576`. All other frames were inventoried from node metadata (names, sizes, text-layer names) only, not visually reviewed. Design-token extraction used `get_design_context` on Login (`3:22750`) only.

## 2. Product overview

### 2.1 Vision (P)
A fast, brand-faithful online store for skincare and cosmetics, paired with an administration dashboard that lets the client run the shop (catalog, stock, orders, content, promotions) without editing code.

### 2.2 Problem statement (A)
The client needs an operable e-commerce business. A design template exists (storefront only). There is no application, no data model, no back-office, and no verification process.

### 2.3 Business objectives (P — to confirm with client)
1. Sell products online with a checkout that works end-to-end.
2. Let non-technical staff manage products, stock, orders and homepage content.
3. Reproduce the supplied design with high, *measurable* visual fidelity.
4. Keep the codebase maintainable and testable so modules can be built one at a time.

### 2.4 Intended users
See section 3.

### 2.5 Product boundaries
- **In:** storefront, admin dashboard, local backend + database, local test payment.
- **Out (for now):** production hosting, real payment/shipping providers, GitHub, Vercel, mobile native apps, multi-vendor marketplace (see 4.3).

### 2.6 Local-first development constraint (V — user instruction)
All work runs on the developer machine. No Vercel deploys, no production configuration, no Git history changes or force-pushes; commits and pushes only to the user's own repository (D-046), each push on request. No remote database, payment provider or cloud API is assumed to exist.

### 2.7 Mandatory technology (V — user instruction)
HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript must remain part of the solution regardless of other choices. See section 10 and `context.md` for how this is honored.

---

## 3. Stakeholders and personas

| Persona | Description | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| **Shopper (guest)** | Browses, searches, uses cart, wishlist, compare, may check out. Evidence: all storefront frames. | V |
| **Registered customer** | Has login/register/forgot-password (`3:22750`, `3:23089`, `3:23424`), tracks orders (`3:23740`). Account dashboard / order history **not designed**. | V (auth), P (account area) |
| **Store owner / client** | Wants to operate the shop without code. Implied by user brief; no Figma evidence. | A |
| **Administrator** | Full access to all admin modules, staff and settings. | P |
| **Catalog / content manager** | Manages products, media, blog, banners, pages. | P |
| **Order-management staff** | Processes orders, updates statuses, adjusts stock. | P |

Personas other than Shopper/Registered customer are proposals because the brief lists them as candidates and no design exists.

---

## 4. Scope and release boundaries

### 4.1 MVP (P)

### 4.3 Explicitly excluded for now (P)
Production deployment, CI/CD, real payment capture, marketplace/multi-vendor, native mobile apps, ERP/accounting integrations, loyalty program.

### 4.4 Dependencies

**Not present in the file (V):** admin dashboard · mobile/tablet frames · account dashboard/order history · order confirmation · tracking result · search-results page · 404/500 pages · loading/skeleton states · cookie banner.

**Design-template observation (V):** the mega-menu "Shop Pages" list names demo layouts (Shop Default, Grid left sidebar, Grid right sidebar, List left sidebar, List right sidebar, Load more, Top Filter, Horizontal Filter, Filter drawer). These are theme demo variants, not a production navigation requirement. Section 14 OQ-06 asks the client which single layout to ship and whether others should be admin-selectable.

## 7. Storefront requirements

Covered by sections 5.1–5.11. Storefront-wide rules:

- **STO-R1 (P):** Storefront reads only *published/active* data; draft or archived items never render publicly.
- **STO-R2 (P):** Prices, stock and totals shown in the UI are advisory; the server recomputes them on cart mutation and order placement.
- **STO-R3 (P):** Every list/detail view defines loading, empty and error states (section 12 NFR-A).
- **STO-R4 (V):** Visual language: Instrument Sans for UI text, Prata for display headings (hero "Glam Defined Perfectly", "Checkout", section titles); near-black `#211a18`, cream `#fdfbf8`/`#f8f5f0`/`#eee9e1`, burgundy `#8e2018`/`#431310`, red `#c7332b`, grays `#736f6d`/`#9e9c9a`/`#ccc8c2`. Extracted from Login (`3:22750`) design context; full token audit is a Phase 2 task (the file defines **no** Figma variables on `3:42576`; other frames not checked).

---

## 8. Administration dashboard requirements

### 8.1 Design status
**No dashboard screens exist in the Figma file (V).** The dashboard is a required product area (the brief says the client must manage the store without code). Recommended: commission or produce admin designs before building admin UI (OQ-24). Proposed UX direction (P): a desktop-first console reusing the storefront's tokens (Instrument Sans, burgundy accent, cream/neutral surfaces) but with denser, utility-focused patterns: left sidebar nav, top bar with user menu, data tables (search, filter, sort, pagination, bulk actions), side-sheet/forms, toast feedback, confirm dialogs. Must be usable at tablet width; full mobile admin is COULD.

### 8.2 Architecture relationship to the storefront (P)
Single source of truth: one database and one domain/service layer. The admin UI and the storefront are two clients of the same services:

```
Admin UI  ─┐                             ┌─> products, variants, stock
           ├─> API / service layer ──────┼─> orders, payments, customers
Storefront ┘   (validation, permissions) ├─> promotions, shipping rules
                                         └─> content (banners, pages, posts, settings)
```
- Admin writes go through permissioned services; storefront reads published data only.
- A product's `status`, `visibility`, variant stock and price changes take effect on the storefront without code changes or redeploys (read-through, no stale static copies; if caching is added, writes must invalidate it).
- Storefront order placement calls the same inventory service the admin uses, so stock cannot diverge.

### 8.3 Dashboard modules

| ID | Module / requirement | Actor | Acceptance criteria | Pri | Ev |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADM-001 | Admin sign-in separate from customer sign-in; session timeout. | Staff | Customer credentials cannot access `/admin`. | MUST | P |

| ARP-001 | Reports: sales by day, top products, low stock. | Admin | Computed from orders table; CSV export COULD. | COULD | P |

### 8.4 Cross-cutting dashboard rules (P)
- **Forms:** same validation schema as API; inline field errors; unsaved-changes guard.
- **Tables:** server-side pagination/sort/filter; URL-reflected state; empty and error states.
- **Concurrency:** optimistic-concurrency check (updated-at/version) on product and order edits to prevent silent overwrites.
- **Publication:** `draft → published → archived`; scheduled publish for blog/banners.
- **Errors:** user-safe messages; technical detail only in server logs.

## 9. Business rules and data model

All entities below are **P** (proposals derived from Figma-visible data fields plus standard commerce needs).

| Entity | Key fields | Relationships / constraints |
|---|---|---|
| Product | id, slug (unique), name, descriptions, status, badges, tags, rating_avg, review_count | has many Variant, Category (M:N), Media, Review |
| Variant | id, product_id, sku (unique), size_label (e.g. 15 ml), color?, price, compare_at_price?, weight | belongs to Product; one InventoryRecord |
| Category | id, slug, name, parent_id?, image, sort, active | hierarchical; product counts derived |
| InventoryRecord | variant_id, on_hand, reserved, low_stock_threshold | `on_hand ≥ 0` unless backorder; movements log |
| Customer | id, email (unique), username, password_hash, status | has Addresses, Orders, Wishlist |
| Cart / CartItem | cart_id, owner (guest token or customer), variant_id, qty | qty ≥1 and ≤ available; merged on login |
| Order | id, public_ref, customer_id?, email, status, totals, billing address snapshot, notes, coupon_id? | immutable price/address snapshot at placement |
| OrderItem | order_id, variant_id, name/sku/price snapshot, qty | — |
| PaymentRecord | order_id, method (cod/bank/mock), status, amount, reference | one or more per order |
| Shipment | order_id, carrier, tracking_no, status | — |
| Discount | code, type, value, min_spend, starts/ends, usage_limit, used_count | validated server-side |
| Review | product_id, customer_id?, rating 1–5, body, recommend, status (pending/approved) | moderation (OQ-16) |
| ContentPage / BlogPost / Banner / StoreLocation | slug, body, status, publish window | managed by admin |
| NewsletterSubscriber / ContactMessage | email/message, consent, created_at | — |
| AdminUser / Role / Permission | user, role, permission set | RBAC; Owner protected |
| AuditLog | actor, action, entity, before, after, at | append-only |

### 9.1 Business rules (all **P** unless noted)

| # | Rule | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| BR-01 | Sellable unit = Variant. SKU unique. | P |
| BR-02 | Displayed price = variant price; if `compare_at_price > price`, show strike-through (Figma shows `$96` with `$110` struck through — V). | V/P |
| BR-03 | Cart total = Σ(line price × qty) − discount + shipping + tax. Computed server-side with integer minor units (cents), never floats. | P |
| BR-04 | Free-shipping progress compares subtotal to threshold from settings. Figma contains **conflicting** thresholds ($100 in announcement bar, $50 in benefit card) — OQ-04. | V conflict |
| BR-05 | Stock reservation/decrement occurs at order placement (not add-to-cart) in MVP. | A |
| BR-06 | Order status machine: `pending → processing → shipped → delivered`; `pending/processing → cancelled`; `paid` orders → `refunded`. Payment states: `pending / paid / failed / refunded`. | P |
| BR-07 | COD / bank transfer orders start `pending` payment; the mock card gateway returns success/failure/pending deterministically for tests. | P |
| BR-08 | Coupon valid only within dates, min spend and usage limit; cannot make total negative. | P |
| BR-09 | A product with orders is archived, never hard-deleted. | P |
| BR-10 | Draft/archived products are hidden from listing, search, direct URL, wishlist (shown as unavailable) and cart (flagged). | P |
| BR-11 | Reviews display only when approved; "Verified" badge only for customers with a delivered order of that product. | P |
| BR-12 | Tracking requires Order ID **and** billing email. | V (form fields) |

Lifecycle diagrams and detailed transition tables will be added to `development-plan.md` task contracts when the owning phase starts.

## 10. Frontend requirements

| Topic | Requirement |
|---|---|
| HTML5 / CSS3 / JS | Semantic HTML5 landmarks; CSS3 (custom properties, grid, flexbox, `clamp()`) for all styling; JavaScript/TypeScript for behavior. These remain first-class and visible in the code (no opaque UI kit that hides the markup/CSS). V (mandatory). |
| Recommended stack | See section 11.1 (**P**, pending approval). |
| Component architecture | Primitives (Button, Input, Badge, Rating, Price), composites (ProductCard, FilterGroup, Drawer, Accordion, Carousel, Breadcrumb), sections (Header, Footer, BenefitStrip), page templates. Derived from repeated patterns seen across frames. |
| Routing | File-system or declarative routes per 6.2; URL reflects filter/sort/page state. |
| Styling & tokens | CSS custom properties for color, type scale, spacing, radius, shadow; tokens sourced from Figma (Phase 2). |
| Forms | Controlled forms with shared validation schema; per-field errors; accessible labels (Figma checkout uses visible labels with `*` required markers). |
| State | Server state via data-fetching layer; local state only for UI; cart/wishlist/compare as a small client store synchronized with the server. |
| Data fetching | Server-rendered pages for catalog/PDP/content (SEO), client fetch for interactive filtering, cart. |
| Assets | Images from the 51-sheet exported to local `/public`/asset pipeline at approved sizes; responsive `srcset`; icons as SVG. **Temporary Figma asset URLs must never be committed.** |
| Responsive | Section 12.2. |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA target (P): keyboard operable menus/drawers/carousels, focus trapping in modals, visible focus, color contrast (to be audited — several grays like `#9e9c9a` on cream may fail), alt text, `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| Browser support | Last 2 versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (P). |
| States | Every data view: loading (skeleton), empty, error with retry, success. None of these are in Figma → must be designed/proposed. |

---

## 11. Backend requirements

### 11.1 Recommended architecture and stack (**all P — pending approval; nothing installed**)

| Area | Recommendation | Why | Alternatives considered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall shape | **Single repository, modular monolith**: storefront + admin + API in one app, separated by route groups and a domain/service layer. | One DB and one rule set for both areas; simplest local setup; clean seams for later extraction. | Separate storefront/admin/API apps (more ops overhead now); static site + headless commerce SaaS (violates "no external service assumed"). |
| Framework | **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript** | SSR/SSG for SEO-heavy catalog, file routing, route handlers, first-class Playwright support, large ecosystem. | Plain multi-page HTML/CSS/JS + Express (maximum HTML/CSS/JS purity, but re-invents routing, templating, bundling; slower for 57 screens); Astro (great for content, weaker for app-like admin); Remix/React Router. |
| Language | TypeScript (compiles to JavaScript) | Shared types between UI, API and DB reduce integration bugs, which matters for AI-generated code. | Plain JS (satisfies the mandate literally but loses type safety). |
| Styling | **Handwritten CSS3** using CSS custom-property tokens + CSS Modules (component-scoped). | Keeps CSS3 first-class and inspectable; high design fidelity; no utility-class churn. | Tailwind (fast, but design-token fidelity via config and long class strings; viable alternative); a UI kit like MUI (fights the custom design). |
| Database | **SQLite for local development via an ORM with a Postgres-compatible schema** (e.g., Drizzle or Prisma). | Zero-install local DB, easy reset for tests. | PostgreSQL local (production-parity; requires install/Docker — not verified available here). **Decision pending (OQ-03).** |
| Validation | Shared schema library (e.g., Zod) used by forms and API. | One source of truth for rules. | Hand-written validators. |
| Auth | Server-side sessions with secure cookies; separate customer and admin session scopes; argon2id/bcrypt. | Simple, no external provider needed. | Auth.js; third-party IdP (needs external accounts). |
| Payments | Provider-agnostic `PaymentGateway` interface + **local mock gateway**; COD/bank-transfer as offline methods. | Matches Figma's offline methods; no live provider assumed. | Stripe etc. later behind same interface. |
| Email | Local "outbox" (logged/stored) in dev. | No SMTP assumed. | Real SMTP later. |
| Images | Local file storage behind a storage interface. | Swap to cloud later. | — |
| Testing | Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E, a11y via axe, screenshots). | See `e2e-testing-strategy.md`. | Cypress. |
| Package manager | npm (already installed, v11.16.0). | No extra install. | pnpm (not installed). |

**Technology decisions pending approval:** framework, styling approach, ORM, database engine for local dev, auth approach (OQ-03). None are approved yet.

### 11.2 API boundaries (P)
Route handlers grouped by domain: `catalog`, `cart`, `checkout/orders`, `auth/account`, `content`, `admin/*`. All endpoints: validate input → authorize → call domain service → return typed JSON with consistent error shape `{code, message, fields?}`.

### 11.3 Business logic, persistence, consistency
- Domain services own rules (pricing, stock, order state machine, coupon validation). UI/route code does not duplicate rules.
- Money in integer minor units; currency from settings.
- Order placement in a single DB transaction (re-validate → decrement stock → create order/items/payment).
- Idempotency key on order placement to prevent duplicates from double-clicks/retries.
- Migrations + deterministic seed data (taxonomy and ~40 products can be seeded from frames `3:42651` and `3:41609` after license/brand approval).

### 11.4 Logging, errors, security
Structured server logs (no PII/secrets), request IDs, user-safe error messages, rate limiting on auth/tracking/contact, security headers, file-upload checks. See SEC-001…007.

### 11.5 Local mock vs real
| Capability | Local phase implementation | Real? |
|---|---|---|
| Database | local file DB | real (local) |
| Auth | real implementation, local users | real (local) |
| Payment card | mock gateway | **mock** |
| COD / bank transfer | offline method records | real logic |
| Email | outbox | **mock** |
| Shipping rates | admin-configured table | real logic, no carrier API |
| Image storage | local disk | real (local) |
| Analytics / geolocation | none | not implemented |

Nothing above exists yet (V: repository is empty).

## 12. Non-functional requirements

### 12.1 Targets (all **P** — need stakeholder approval)

| Area | Target |
|---|---|
| Performance | LCP ≤ 2.5 s and CLS ≤ 0.1 on catalog/PDP on a mid-range laptop against local production build; API p95 < 300 ms on 1k-product seed. |
| Scalability | Designed for ≥10k products and ≥100k orders without schema change; pagination everywhere (no unbounded lists). |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA; automated axe checks have zero critical/serious violations on MVP routes. |
| Security | SEC-001…007; no secrets in repo. |
| Reliability | Order placement transactional; no partial orders on failure. |
| Maintainability | Strict TypeScript, lint/format, domain-based folders, one shared token file. |
| Testability | Every module has stable `data-testid`s on key controls and seedable data. |
| Observability | Request-ID logs; admin audit log; error boundary reporting to local log. |
| Local DX | `npm install && npm run dev` + seed command bring the app up from a clean clone; documented in README (when created). |

### 12.2 Responsive requirements

**Figma-defined (V):** a single desktop width of **1920 px**. No tablet or mobile design exists.
**Proposed (P):** design-implementation reference 1920 px; engineering breakpoints (to confirm, OQ-07): ≥1440 (wide desktop), 1024–1439 (desktop), 768–1023 (tablet), 360–767 (mobile). Test viewports in the E2E strategy: 1920×1080, 1440×900, 1024×768, 768×1024, 390×844.

Proposed responsive behavior (all P):

| Pattern | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Header | Collapses to logo + search + cart + hamburger; mega menu becomes accordion drawer. |
| Product grid | 3–4 col → 2 col (tablet) → 2 col compact or 1 col (mobile). |
| Shop filters | Sidebar becomes the existing **Filter Drawer** pattern (`3:11424`). |
| PDP | Gallery above info; sticky add-to-cart bar on mobile; thumbnails horizontal scroll. |
| Cart table | Becomes stacked cards. |
| Checkout | Order summary moves above/below form; single column. |
| Carousels | Swipe + visible controls. |
| Tables (admin) | Horizontal scroll or card view; sidebar becomes drawer. |
| Hero/banners | Art-directed crops needed — **missing design**; may need client review. |

Desktop-only (no responsive design) screens: **all 60 frames**.

### 12.3 Visual fidelity
Goal: high, *measured* fidelity to the 1920 px designs through screenshot comparison per `e2e-testing-strategy.md`. 100% pixel-perfect rendering across all browsers/devices is **not** guaranteed or promised.

## 14. Risks, assumptions and open questions

### 14.1 Risks (ordered by impact)

| # | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **No admin designs** — dashboard UX will be invented | High | Approve admin UX direction (8.1) before Phase 8; build on a small design system |
| R2 | **No mobile/tablet designs** — responsive behavior is invented | High | Approve breakpoints and responsive rules; get a few key mobile mocks (Home, PDP, Checkout) |
| R3 | **Many alternate layouts** (10 listing, 11 PDP, 6 blog) could balloon scope | High | Pick one layout per route (OQ-06) |
| R4 | Business rules undefined (shipping, tax, variants, payments, returns) | High | Resolve OQ-04, OQ-05, OQ-11, OQ-12 early |
| R5 | Template data conflicts (shipping thresholds, store addresses, copyright "2026", multiple locations) | Medium | Treat design text as placeholder; get real content |
| R6 | Asset/brand rights (COSMIA brand, photography) | Medium | Confirm ownership/licence (OQ-01, OQ-02) |
| R7 | Visual fidelity drift in AI-generated code | Medium | Token-first approach + screenshot gates |
| R8 | Design-token extraction is partial (only Login sampled; no Figma variables seen) | Medium | Phase 2 token audit across frames |
| R9 | Missing states (loading, error, 404, confirmation, account) | Medium | Propose and approve a minimal state set |
| R10 | Colour-contrast / accessibility issues in the design (light grays on cream) | Medium | Audit; adjust with approval |
| R11 | Frames only inventoried, not all reviewed | Low-Medium | Visually review each frame at the start of its phase |

### 14.2 Assumptions
A1 Guest checkout allowed. A2 USD default currency (EN/USD selectors shown). A3 Single store, single language in MVP. A4 Stock is decremented at order placement. A5 Overlay frames (cart drawer, size guide, share, compare popup, quick view) are overlays on the product page/home. A6 Design copy is placeholder content.

### 14.3 Open questions

| ID | Question | Why it matters | Default if unanswered |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-01 | Is "COSMIA" the real brand? Real name, logo, copy? | Branding, legal | Keep COSMIA as placeholder |
| OQ-02 | Who owns / licenses the photography and the template design? | Legal | Use as dev placeholders only |
| OQ-03 | Approve stack (framework, styling, ORM, DB for local)? Is Docker/PostgreSQL acceptable? | Foundation of everything | Section 11.1 |
| OQ-04 | Shipping rules, free-shipping threshold ($50 vs $100), countries, tax/VAT? | Checkout correctness | $100 threshold (announcement bar), flat rate table, no tax |
| OQ-05 | Which payment methods at launch (card provider? COD? bank transfer?) | Checkout scope | Mock card + COD + bank transfer |
| OQ-06 | Which single layout to ship for Shop, PDP gallery/zoom, Blog? Should others be admin-selectable? | Scope (3×) | Shop left sidebar grid; Details default; Blog grid |
| OQ-07 | Breakpoints and mobile designs? | Responsive build | Section 12.2 |
| OQ-08 | Priority of Compare, Quick view, Subscribe-and-save, Bundles? | MVP size | Later release |
| OQ-09 | Guest checkout allowed? Account required for tracking? | UX/data | Guest allowed |
| OQ-10 | Compare item limit? | CMP-001 | 4 |
| OQ-11 | Variant model: sizes only, or shade/color too? Many products show "Color" filter (7 swatches) | Data model | Size first, color later |
| OQ-12 | Backorders / pre-orders allowed? Reservation timing? | Inventory | No backorders |
| OQ-13 | How do bundles price/work? | HOM-007 | Defer |
| OQ-14 | Sort options (best seller, newest, price asc/desc, rating)? "Best seller" definition? | CAT-004 | Those five; best seller = units sold |
| OQ-15 | Category taxonomy: 5, 9 or 12 categories (frame `3:42651`)? | Seed data | Demo 3 (12) |
| OQ-16 | Review moderation required? Who can review? | PRD-006 | Moderated; verified buyers show badge |
| OQ-17 | "Related products" rule (same category? manual?) | PRD-007 | Same category |
| OQ-18 | Is subscription billing wanted? | Complexity | Defer |
| OQ-19 | Share targets? | PRD-015 | Copy link only |
| OQ-20 | Guest→account cart merge rule? | CRT-004 | Merge, sum quantities |
| OQ-21 | Order ID format? | TRK | `CSM-` + 8 alphanumerics |
| OQ-22 | Store-locator distance — real geolocation or static? | CNT-005 | Static list, no distance |
| OQ-23 | Newsletter 20% offer — auto-generated code? | NWS-001 | Manual code in admin |
| OQ-24 | Who designs the admin dashboard? | R1 | Claude proposes wireframes for approval |
| OQ-25 | Languages/currencies beyond EN/USD? | Header selectors | Visual only in MVP |
| OQ-26 | Returns/refund policy ("15 days") — need an RMA flow? | Orders | Record-only refunds |

## 15. Traceability

Model: **Figma frame → page/template → requirement → implementation module → E2E test.**
Implementation modules and E2E IDs are *planned names*; nothing is implemented yet. Test IDs are defined in `e2e-testing-strategy.md` §5 (format `E2E-<MODULE>-nn`).
