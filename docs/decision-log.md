# Decision Log

Purpose: record **why** development decisions were made, so that when something breaks later, a future session (or person) can find the context quickly instead of guessing.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | 0.2 |
| Created | 2026-10-19 |
| Owner | Claude Code sessions, reviewed by the project owner |
| Related | `context.md` (current state), `PRD.md` (requirements), `development-plan.md` (phases), `e2e-testing-strategy.md` |

## How to use this log

1. **When debugging:** check the *Troubleshooting index* (§2) first, then read the linked decision entry — it states what was chosen, what was rejected, and what would justify reversing it.
2. **When making a decision:** append a new entry **before or together with** the change. Never edit history; if a decision is reversed, add a new entry and mark the old one `SUPERSEDED by D-xxx`.
3. **Update related docs:** if a decision changes scope, stack or status, also update `context.md` §16 and the owning document.
4. Do not record secrets or credentials here.

### Entry format
`D-nnn · date · phase · Status` — **Decision**, **Context**, **Alternatives considered**, **Rationale**, **Consequences / watch-outs**, **Revisit when**, **Decided by**.

### Status values
- `APPROVED` — explicitly approved by the user.
- `ADOPTED-DEFAULT` — the user did not answer the question; Claude adopted the PRD default so work could proceed. **Provisional**; confirm with the user.
- `DECIDED` — an implementation choice within Claude's remit, made with reasons.
- `SUPERSEDED` — replaced by a later entry.

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| `better-sqlite3` fails to load / build error after a Node upgrade | D-007 |
| "Cannot open database", `SQLITE_BUSY`, locked `.db` file on Windows | D-007, D-011, D-012 |
| Admin edits not showing on the storefront; stale pages | D-009 |
| `LayoutProps` / type-not-found errors from generated Next types | D-014 |

| `test:reset` "Refusing to reset…" | D-012 |
| Build warning "tracing the whole project" | D-007 (config note) |
| `npm audit` reports vulnerabilities | D-013 |
| `create-next-app` refuses to run in the repo | D-006 |
| Unexpected `.git`, remote, or deploy config appears | D-002, D-015 |
| Styling mismatch with Figma, fonts missing | D-008, D-005 |
| A business rule looks "wrong" (shipping threshold, payments, layouts) | D-004 |
| Windows script/encoding problems (`jq`, Python charmap errors) | D-017 |
| Text too light / contrast failures (known, accepted: Figma colors kept exactly) | D-033, D-022 |
| Header/footer missing on a page, wrong chrome on Home or 404 | D-023 |
| Filters/sort/pagination behave oddly, a filter "disappears" after fast clicks | D-024, D-025, D-031 |
| Search returns nothing for `%`/`_` or special characters | D-024, D-026 |
| A menu link opens the 404 page, or several mega-menu entries open the same page | D-034 (unbuilt pages / layout variants) |
| Product page shows 404 for a product that exists | D-024 (only `published` products are public) |
| Size labels look wrong ("15ml" vs "15 ml") | D-031 |
| Home sections empty or missing | D-021, D-028 (content comes from the `banners` table: run `npm run db:seed`) |
| Flash-sale banner disappeared | D-028 (it ends 2d 8h 30m after seeding, by design) |
| Images look soft on a retina display | D-020, D-029 (Figma exports are 1x for cards) |
| `Port 3000 is in use` / pages show stale UI / hydration warning after editing many files | D-032 |
| `mv`/rename of a folder fails with "Permission denied" while `next dev` runs | D-032 |
| Playwright run is slow or hangs on `networkidle` | D-030 |
| A page returns wrong data in E2E but is right in dev | D-030 (E2E uses `data/test.db`, reset and seeded each run) |
| Review submitted but not visible on the product page | D-027 (reviews are pending until approved; admin moderation arrives in P9) |

## 3. Entries

### D-001 · 2026-10-19 · P0 · APPROVED — Start P0 and P1
- **Decision:** Proceed with P0 (approval) and P1 (foundation) of `development-plan.md`. The user's instruction ("start from … P0 … and P1") is treated as approval of the four documents and of the P1 scope **only**. P2 onward still needs explicit go-ahead.
- **Context:** The previous task ended with "wait for approval". The user then asked for `decision-log.md` and to start P0/P1.
- **Alternatives:** Ask the user to answer every open question first (rejected: it would block P1, which is not blocked by them).
- **Consequences:** The user did **not** individually answer OQ-03…OQ-26; see D-004/D-005 for what was assumed.
- **Revisit when:** Before starting P2/P3.
- **Decided by:** User.

### D-002 · 2026-10-19 · P0 · APPROVED — Local-only development
- **Decision:** No `git init`, no GitHub push, no Vercel/deploy, no production config, no remote DB or real provider. `create-next-app` was run with `--disable-git`; `.vercel` is git-ignored.
- **Context:** Explicit user restriction in the master prompt.
- **Consequences:** The directory is **not** a Git repository (verified: `fatal: not a git repository`). Test reports therefore cannot use commit hashes (see `e2e-testing-strategy.md` §8).
- **Revisit when:** The user explicitly approves version control/deployment. Add a new entry then.
- **Decided by:** User.

### D-003 · 2026-10-19 · P0 · DECIDED — Figma inspected incrementally
- **Decision:** Inventory from metadata, then visually review representative frames only (Home, Shop, Details, Checkout, `49`, `50`, `51`), and sample tokens from Login.
- **Context:** Whole-page `get_metadata` was ~3.2 MB and `get_design_context` for one small frame was ~65 KB.
- **Consequences:** ~53 of 60 frames were not visually reviewed. **Review each frame fully at the start of its phase**; do not trust layer-name-derived requirements as final. Temporary Figma asset URLs expire and must never be committed.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-004 · 2026-10-19 · P0 · ADOPTED-DEFAULT — Open questions answered by PRD defaults
The user did not answer these; the PRD §14.3 defaults are used **provisionally** so work is not blocked. None of them affects P1 code.

| OQ | Default now in force | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-04 | Free shipping at $100 (announcement bar) — design also shows $50 | P5/P6 (settings-driven, so cheap to change) |
| OQ-05 | Mock card + COD + bank transfer | P6 |
| OQ-06 | One layout per route: Shop left-sidebar grid, Details default, Blog grid | P4, P10 |
| OQ-07 | Breakpoints ≥1440 / 1024–1439 / 768–1023 / 360–767 | P2, P11 |
| OQ-09 | Guest checkout allowed | P6 |
| OQ-11/12 | Size variants first; no backorders | P3 |
| OQ-15 | 12-category taxonomy (Demo 3) | P3 seed |
| OQ-24 | Claude proposes admin wireframes for approval | P7 |

- **Revisit when:** Before the phase that consumes each answer. If any changes, update `PRD.md` §14.3, this entry, and the plan.
- **Decided by:** Claude (provisional); confirm with user.

### D-005 · 2026-10-19 · P0 · ADOPTED-DEFAULT — Technology stack
- **Decision:** Modular monolith (storefront + admin + API in one repo). Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript; handwritten CSS3 with CSS Modules; SQLite + Drizzle ORM locally; Zod validation; Vitest + Playwright (+axe); npm.
- **Context:** HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript are mandatory; everything else was left to evaluation. Repository was empty, so no architecture to preserve.
- **Alternatives:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS + Express (maximum purity, but re-implements routing/templating/bundling for ~57 screens); Astro (strong for content, weaker for the admin app); Tailwind (viable; rejected for token fidelity and inspectable CSS); PostgreSQL locally (parity, but Docker/Postgres not verified present).
- **Rationale:** One DB + one rule set for both storefront and admin; SSR for SEO; shared types reduce integration bugs in AI-written code; first-class Playwright support. Full reasoning: `PRD.md` §11.1.
- **Versions at install (2026-10-19):** Next 16.4.2, React 19.3.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Drizzle ORM 0.45.4 / kit 0.31.11, better-sqlite3 13.0.3, Zod 4.6.7, Vitest 5.0.5, Playwright 1.64.1, Prettier 3.9.10, ESLint 9.39.5.
- **Revisit when:** Postgres becomes required (D-007); the client rejects a React-based stack.
- **Decided by:** Claude (provisional); confirm with user.

### D-006 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Scaffold in a temp directory, then copy
- **Decision:** `create-next-app` refuses a non-empty directory (the four `.md` docs "could conflict"). It was run in the session scratchpad with `--skip-install --disable-git`, and the generated files were copied into the project root with `cp -rn` (no overwrite). Dependencies were then installed in the root.
- **Alternatives:** Move docs out and back (risk of loss); delete docs (forbidden); hand-write the scaffold (loses upstream defaults).
- **Consequences:** `package.json` `name` was changed from `app` to `beauty-ecommerce`. Original docs untouched.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-007 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · ADOPTED-DEFAULT — SQLite (better-sqlite3) + Drizzle
- **Decision:** Local DB is a SQLite file (`./data/dev.db`, tests use `./data/test.db`) accessed through Drizzle ORM and `better-sqlite3`, with `journal_mode=WAL` and `foreign_keys=ON`. Next is told not to bundle the native module (`serverExternalPackages`).
- **Context:** OQ-03 (local DB engine) was unanswered; Docker/Postgres availability is unverified.
- **Evidence:** Native module loaded and queried successfully on Node v24.18.0 / Windows 11 (prebuilt binary; no compiler needed).
- **Alternatives:** `@libsql/client` (prebuilt, SQLite-compatible), Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (newer API), local PostgreSQL (needs install/Docker).
- **Consequences / watch-outs:**
  - Schema should stay Postgres-portable (avoid SQLite-only features) so a later move is a driver/config change plus migration regeneration.
  - SQLite allows one writer; E2E runs with 1 worker (D-011).
  - On Windows a running app/test server can lock the `.db` file; stop servers before deleting it. `-wal`/`-shm` side files are deleted by `test:reset`.
  - `src/db/config.ts` resolves the path at runtime from `process.cwd()`; it carries `/*turbopackIgnore: true*/` to silence the "whole project traced" build warning. This is intentional.
- **Revisit when:** Concurrency needs outgrow SQLite, deployment targets a hosted DB, or a Node upgrade breaks the native binary (switch to libsql).
- **Decided by:** Claude (provisional).

### D-008 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · ADOPTED-DEFAULT — Styling approach
- **Decision:** Scaffolded with `--no-tailwind`; styling will be handwritten CSS3 with custom-property tokens and CSS Modules. The scaffold's Google "Geist" fonts were removed from the layout; the placeholder uses `system-ui`.
- **Rationale:** Keeps CSS3 first-class and inspectable (mandatory requirement) and avoids network-dependent font fetches during build. Design fonts (Instrument Sans, Prata) arrive in P2 after a licensing/self-hosting check.
- **Consequences:** `globals.css` is minimal on purpose. Do **not** hardcode colors/fonts later; add tokens in P2.
- **Decided by:** Claude (provisional).

### D-009 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Cache Components disabled
- **Decision:** The scaffold enabled `cacheComponents: true` and `partialPrefetching: true`. Both were removed from `next.config.ts`.
- **Context:** The product requires admin changes (price, stock, publish, banners) to show on the storefront without redeploys. Cache Components changes data-fetching rules (uncached dynamic data must sit under Suspense / explicit caching) and adds stale-content risk before a caching strategy exists.
- **Alternatives:** Keep and adopt now (premature); disable permanently (not decided).
- **Consequences:** Pages render with Next's standard behavior. Route handlers are marked `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` where DB state matters (e.g. `/api/health`).
- **Revisit when:** P4 decides the catalog caching strategy. Any caching added must be invalidated by admin writes (PRD §8.2).
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-010 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Placeholder schema only
- **Decision:** `src/db/schema.ts` contains one table, `app_meta`, to prove generate → migrate → read/write. Migration `drizzle/0000_*.sql` is generated and applied. Catalog/order/user schema is P3.
- **Rationale:** P1 scope is foundation, not data modeling; variant model (OQ-11) is still provisional.
- **Consequences:** `npm run db:seed` is a stub that writes `seeded_at`.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-011 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — E2E against a production build and a fresh test DB
- **Decision:** `playwright.config.ts` starts `npm run test:reset && npm run build && npm run start -- -p 3100` with `DATABASE_URL` pointed at `./data/test.db`. One worker, chromium at 1920×1080 only. `reuseExistingServer: false`.
- **Rationale:** Tests exercise what would run for real (not dev-mode behavior), never touch the dev DB, and start from known state (`e2e-testing-strategy.md` §6). Port 3100 avoids clashing with `npm run dev` on 3000. The reset runs inside the server command so the DB file is never open when it is deleted (Windows locking).
- **Consequences:** Each E2E run rebuilds (~20 s now; grows with the app). `fullyParallel` is off until specs isolate their data.
- **Revisit when:** Run time becomes painful (add a reuse mode) or multiple workers are needed (per-worker DB files).
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-012 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Guarded destructive reset
- **Decision:** `scripts/test-reset.ts` deletes and recreates a DB, but refuses unless the path is inside `./data` **and** the file name contains "test". Verified: `./data/dev.db` and `../evil-test.db` both refused with exit code 1.
- **Rationale:** Prevents an env-var mistake from wiping development data.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-013 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Dev-only audit advisories accepted
- **Decision:** `npm audit` reports 9 issues (4 moderate, 5 high). They come from two **dev-tooling** chains: `drizzle-kit → @esbuild-kit/* → esbuild`, and `eslint-config-next → @next/eslint-plugin-next → fast-glob → micromatch → braces`. `npm audit --omit=dev` reports **0**. `npm audit fix --force` was **not** run.
- **Rationale:** Forced fixes would downgrade/upgrade major versions of core tooling and could break the pipeline; these packages never ship to production or run on user input.
- **Revisit when:** Upstream releases patched `drizzle-kit`/`eslint-config-next`, and before any deployment decision. Re-run `npm audit --omit=dev`.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-014 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Strict TypeScript and tooling
- **Decision:** `tsconfig` adds `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`. Prettier (width 100, double quotes) with `eslint-config-prettier`. `@types/node` pinned to 24 to match the installed Node. The layout types `children` explicitly because Next's global `LayoutProps` type exists only after Next generates types (it caused `tsc` to fail on a clean checkout). Vitest config is `.mts` (the project is CommonJS; avoids a Vite loader warning). `*.md` files are excluded from Prettier (hand-formatted docs).
- **Consequences:** Indexed access returns `T | undefined`; handle it. Scripts (`tsx`) use relative imports inside `src/db` rather than the `@/` alias.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-015 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Session-hook suggestions not followed
- **Decision:** The session start hook suggested "greenfield: scaffold immediately", installing the Vercel CLI, and Marketplace/Vercel workflows. Not followed beyond what the user approved: no Vercel CLI, no linking, no Marketplace integration, no deployment.
- **Rationale:** Direct user instructions (D-002) take precedence over plugin hints. Vercel skills may be consulted later for Next.js guidance, but never to deploy.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-016 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Project instruction files
- **Decision:** Added a project `CLAUDE.md` (short pointer to `context.md`, this log, and the rules) and replaced the scaffold `README.md` with local setup instructions. Skipped create-next-app's `AGENTS.md` (`--no-agents-md`) to avoid two competing instruction files.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-017 · 2026-10-19 · P1 · DECIDED — Windows/tooling notes
- `jq` and `pnpm` are not installed; use Python or Node for JSON work.
- Python on this machine defaults to the cp1252 codec: open files with `encoding="utf8"` and call `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf8")` when printing Figma text (emoji/special characters). Note `python -I` ignores `PYTHONIOENCODING`.
- The Bash tool is Git Bash; use forward slashes. Scratch files go to the session scratchpad, not the project.
- Playwright browsers are cached outside the repo (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright`; Chromium only installed).
- `npm` 11 prints "allow-scripts" warnings for install scripts (`unrs-resolver`, `esbuild`); the project works without approving them (build, tests pass). `better-sqlite3` loaded without approval because a prebuilt binary was used.

### D-018 · 2026-10-19 · P2 · DECIDED — Design tokens and self-hosted fonts
- **Decision:** All colors, type sizes, spacing and layout widths live in `src/styles/tokens.css`. Color names follow the Figma styles reported by `get_design_context`: Dark-01 `#211a18`, Dark-02 `#4a403d`, Dark-03, Light-01 `#fdfbf8`, Light-03 `#9e9c9a`, BG-Body `#f8f5f0`, BG-Light-01 `#eee9e1`, BG-Dark `#241c1b`, Primary `#c7332b`, Accent 1 `#431310`, **Secondary** `#8e2018`, **Accent 2** `#356b4a` (green, "Verified"), Border Light `#ccc8c2`, Border dark `#514743`. Fonts are **Instrument Sans (variable)** and **Prata**, self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans` and `@fontsource/prata` (both OFL-1.1).
- **Why self-hosted:** no build-time network fetch (unlike `next/font/google`), works offline, licence is clear.
- **Gotcha:** Figma's "Accent 2" is the *green*, "Secondary" is the burgundy. An early version of this project had them swapped; fixed.
- **Container:** 1320px content column measured from the 1920px frames (x=300..1620).
- **Revisit when:** a full token audit across all 60 frames is done (only ~12 frames were sampled); Figma variables are published.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-019 · 2026-10-19 · P2 · DECIDED — Icons and exported SVG artwork
- **Decision:** UI icons are an inline Feather-style set in `src/components/ui/Icon.tsx` (the design's icon layers are named after Feather: "chevron-down 1", "map-pin 1" ...). The benefit-strip icons, B Corp badge, payment icons and social icons were exported from Figma as single SVGs (`public/images/ui`) and the export canvas rectangles were stripped (`#F5F5F5` canvas + 1920x4263 frame fill).
- **Alternatives:** use the exported per-layer SVG fragments (positioned pieces, not usable standalone).
- **Consequences:** a few icons (e.g. the Home feature icons, "hand" glyph) are approximations of the design's custom artwork.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-020 · 2026-10-19 · P3 · DECIDED — Catalog seed data derived from Figma (and corrections)
- **Decision:** The 36 products come from the Figma product grid (frame `3:41609`): names, type · size labels, prices, compare-at prices (when a card shows two prices the higher is compare-at), badges and review counts are the design's values. `src/db/seed/catalog-data.ts` is generated from them.
- **Demo data (not in Figma):** ratings (3.8-4.9), colors (7 swatches, hex from the filter chips), category assignment (taxonomy frame `3:42651`, grouped under Skincare/Makeup), stock (everything 60 except "Glass glow primer" = 0), extra size variants for the serum (15/30/50 ml, demo prices), `rating_breakdown`.
- **Corrections to template copy-paste errors:** Soft focus concealer "Highlighter · 8g" -> Concealer · 8ml; Scalp renewal scrub "Eyeshadow · 12g" -> Scrub · 150ml; Lip repair balm "150 ml" -> 15ml; "Moisturiser" -> "Moisturizer".
- **Images:** exported per card (the *top* layer when a card has two stacked image rectangles). Several 308x359 exports are low resolution on retina screens.
- **Revisit when:** real catalog data/imagery is supplied (OQ-01/02); seed is only for development and tests.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-021 · 2026-10-19 · P3/P4 · DECIDED — Long-form product content and Home content storage
- **Decision:** (a) `products.content` holds structured JSON (benefits, usage, ingredients, clinical stats, ingredient highlight cards), validated with Zod on read (`src/lib/product-content.ts`); malformed content hides the sections instead of breaking the page. (b) Home content lives in the `banners` table by `slot` with a `data` JSON column (`home-hero`, `home-categories`, `home-marquee`, `home-fresh-drops`, `home-features`, `home-editorial`, `home-flash`, `home-testimonials`, `home-journal`, `home-instagram`, `home-newsletter`), so the admin can manage it in P9 (ACN-001).
- **Placeholder copy:** the serum's text is the design's placeholder copy with the product name adapted (the design copy describes a "serum tint"). Replace in the admin.
- **Bundles:** the Home "Explore bundle" (HOM-007, COULD) uses four curated bundles defined in `src/server/content/bundles.ts` with a 20% discount (matches the design's $110 -> $88) until bundles are modeled (OQ-13).
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-022 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED (color changes SUPERSEDED by D-033) — Accessibility adjustments to Figma colors
- **Context:** axe flagged contrast failures that come straight from the design (PRD risk R10).
- **Decision:** `--color-dark-03` (muted text) darkened from Figma `#736f6d` to `#6b6764` (4.11:1 -> 4.64:1 on the beige `#eee9e1`); struck-through compare-at prices no longer use 50% opacity (it gave <2:1); red text on dark surfaces uses `--color-primary-light #ee6a5f` (Figma `#c7332b` is ~3:1 on `#241c1b`); footer headings on the dark Home footer use Light-03.
- **Also:** ARIA fixes (`role="img"` on rating spans, names on image-only links, logo accessible name contains its visible text, pagination names contain "01").
- **Visual impact:** small; compare-at prices are slightly darker than the design.
- **Revisit when:** the client approves a different palette; the rule is WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1 text).
- **Decided by:** Claude (flag to user: deviates from Figma values).

### D-023 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED — Route groups, per-request rendering, two chromes
- **Decision:** `src/app/layout.tsx` is only the document shell. `(site)` has the standard header/footer (Shop, Product, Search, Categories, `/category`, dev catalog); `(home)` has the Home chrome (dark translucent header over the hero, dark footer with newsletter card). The global `not-found.tsx` renders inside `SiteChrome`. Pages that read live data use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (extends D-009).
- **Why:** Home's header/footer differ structurally from every other frame.
- **Watch-outs:** do not move route folders while `next dev` runs on Windows (D-032); stale `.next/dev/types` can break `tsc` after moving routes: delete `.next`.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-024 · 2026-10-19 · P3 · DECIDED — Catalog query design
- **Rules implemented:** only `published` products are public (BR-10); displayed price is the **default variant** (BR-02); parent categories expand to their children; size filter uses variant `size_ml` buckets (Mini <=20, Standard 21-40, Large 41-50, Jumbo >50) and matches *any* variant; availability "in stock" = any variant with `on_hand - reserved > 0`; "on sale" = default variant has `compare_at > price`.
- **Facets:** disjunctive counting (each group is counted with every other filter applied, not its own).
- **Search:** SQL `LIKE` over name, type, short description, ingredients, tags and category names; each word must match; `%`/`_`/`\` escaped (searched literally). Chosen over SQLite FTS for simplicity at this catalog size.
- **Pagination:** page size 12 (max 48), out-of-range page clamps to the last page. **Parsing:** pages drop invalid parameters (never fatal); the API answers 400 with `{code, message, fields}`.
- **Performance note:** facet counts run ~30 small queries per request; fine for tens/hundreds of products, revisit (single grouped query / caching with admin invalidation) before 10k products.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-025 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED — Filter sidebar is URL-driven; /category redirects
- **Decision:** every filter change rewrites the query string and the server renders the results (shareable, back/forward, reload-safe). `/category/[slug]` redirects to `/shop?category=slug` (one listing implementation).
- **Bug fixed:** two quick clicks used a stale `useSearchParams()` and lost the first filter; the sidebar now builds each URL from the latest pushed params (`useRef`, synced when no navigation is pending). Found by E2E-CAT-03.
- **Deferred:** grid/list toggle (the design has 10 listing layouts; one shipped, OQ-06).
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-026 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED — Search overlay and results page
- **Decision:** the header search opens a native `<dialog>` (focus trap and Escape for free) with live suggestions from `GET /api/search` (200 ms debounce, aborts stale requests). Enter goes to `/search?q=`, which reuses the Shop listing so filters and sort still apply. Without JavaScript the icon is a plain link to `/search`. The Home header shows a "Search Product..." field that opens the same overlay.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-027 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED — Reviews: submit for moderation
- **Decision:** `POST /api/catalog/products/[slug]/reviews` stores a review as `pending` (hidden); one review per email per product (409 on a repeat); `is_verified` is never set from the form (only from an order in P6); the reviewer's email is stored privately and never returned. The storefront shows approved reviews only (BR-11).
- **Not built:** moderation UI (P9), rate limiting (SEC-004, P6), "Verified" from real orders.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-028 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · DECIDED — Home page structure
- **Sections (all data-driven):** hero, category cards (count shown on hover), marquee, Trending now (collection `trending-now`), Fresh drops (banner + collection `fresh-drops`), feature strip, editorial banner, Most loved (collection `most-loved`), flash sale, testimonials + bundle builder, journal (banner cards until the blog exists in P10), Instagram strip, dark footer.
- **Flash sale:** `ends_at` is set to seed time + 2d 8h 30m 16s (as in the design); the countdown ticks via `useSyncExternalStore` (server/hydration snapshot is `null`, so no mismatch) and the section disappears when it ends (HOM-006).
- **Hero:** one seeded slide; arrows and the 01/02/03 index appear only when there is more than one slide.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-029 · 2026-10-19 · P2-P4 · DECIDED — Deferred items and deviations from Figma
Not built yet (owner phase in brackets): add-to-cart / wishlist / compare / buy-now behavior and header counts (P5); full mega-menu promo panel (only dropdowns exist); quick view modal, size-guide modal, share modal (share copies the link); grid/list toggle and alternate shop/PDP layouts (OQ-06); color/subscribe/countdown PDP variants; zoom variants; reviewer avatar photos and "Shade ..." lines; decorative leaf imagery in the footer; mobile/tablet navigation (no hamburger: under 1100px the nav is hidden) and most responsive polish (P11); newsletter and contact persistence (P10); blog (P10); Home bundle "Add to cart" (P5).
Visible differences: initials instead of reviewer photos; "Sort by" instead of the design's "Short by" typo; muted-gray and compare-at price colors (D-022); category numbering on /categories follows tree order, not the design's template numbering.
- **Decided by:** Claude. Confirm what the client wants for each before the owning phase.

### D-030 · 2026-10-19 · P2-P4 · DECIDED — Test approach and gates for UI phases
- **Gates run for P2-P4:** `typecheck`, `lint`, `format:check`, Vitest (55), production build, Playwright (42) against a production build with a freshly reset **and seeded** test DB (`npm run test:reset` now seeds), axe (critical/serious must be 0) on 7 routes plus the search overlay.
- **Why not `networkidle`:** image-heavy pages never settle; tests wait for a heading instead.
- **E2E_REUSE=1** lets you run against a server you started yourself (faster iteration); the default always rebuilds.
- **Visual verification:** screenshot capture script `tests/visual/capture.mjs` (scrolls the page so lazy images load, disables animations). Figma references were compared side by side for Shop, PDP, Home, Search and Categories (see `e2e-testing-strategy.md` section 12). **No automated pixel-diff thresholds exist yet.**
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-031 · 2026-10-19 · P2-P4 · DECIDED — Defects found by tests and how they were fixed
| # | Found by | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | integration test | `getRelatedProducts` used Drizzle `.where()` twice; the second **replaced** the first, so a product could list itself as related | single combined `and(...)` |
| 2 | E2E-PRD-01 | a literal backspace character (from `"\b"` written through a Python string) was inside the `displaySize` regex, so "15ml" never became "15 ml" | removed the control character |
| 3 | E2E-CAT-03 | quick successive filter clicks lost a filter (stale search params) | D-025 |
| 4 | axe | contrast, ARIA and accessible-name failures | D-022 |
| 5 | dev run | hydration warning on `Icon` after adding icons while the server ran (stale HMR module) | restart `next dev` (D-032) |
| 6 | test | literal `%` search matched the serum because its ingredient list contains "(5%)" | test corrected: literal match is the correct behavior |
- **Lesson:** run E2E for every UI module; unit tests alone would have missed #2 and #3.

### D-032 · 2026-10-19 · P2-P4 · DECIDED — Local server and tooling operations (Windows)
- Only one `next dev` per project: a second one exits ("Another next dev server is already running"). If port 3000 is "in use by an unknown process", find the node process (PowerShell `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000`) and stop it.
- After editing many files (or adding icons/modules) restart `next dev` and delete `.next` if you see stale UI or hydration warnings.
- Windows locks folders a running dev server watches: stop it before moving/renaming route folders.
- Bash tool notes: `cd` persists between calls (use absolute paths); Git Bash rewrites a leading `/` in arguments (use `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`); long multi-heredoc commands can fail to parse (write script files instead); Python needs `encoding="utf8"`.
- Production-like check: `npm run e2e` builds and serves on port 3100 against `data/test.db`; `npm run dev` serves on 3000 against `data/dev.db`.
- **Decided by:** Claude.

### D-033 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · APPROVED — Exact Figma colors; docs folder; fonts verified
- **User decision (answer to the D-022 question):** keep the Figma values **exactly**. `--color-dark-03` is `#736f6d` again, struck-through prices are dimmed to 50-60% again, red text on dark uses Figma's `#c7332b`, footer headings on the dark Home footer use Dark03. The extra `--color-primary-light` token was removed. **D-022's color changes are therefore superseded**; its ARIA/accessible-name fixes stay.
- **Consequence:** some pairs are below WCAG AA 4.5:1 (muted gray on the beige cards 4.1:1, struck-through prices ~1.9:1, red on dark ~3:1, Dark03 on the dark footer). This is accepted. The E2E accessibility gate (`tests/e2e/fixtures/axe.ts`) fails on any critical/serious violation **except `color-contrast`**, and records the number of contrast findings as a test annotation (`known-contrast-findings`) so the debt stays visible.
- **Docs folder:** the five planning documents (`PRD.md`, `context.md`, `development-plan.md`, `e2e-testing-strategy.md`, `decision-log.md`) now live in `docs/`. `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` stay in the project root (Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` from the root). Documents refer to each other by bare file name because they share the folder.
- **Fonts (verified in a browser):** Prata renders headings, the logo and display titles; Instrument Sans (400/500/600) renders everything else. Both are Google Fonts. They are installed from the npm packages `@fontsource/prata` and `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans` (the same Google font files, served from this project, no request to Google at runtime). The tokens now list the exact Figma family names: `"Instrument Sans Variable", "Instrument Sans"` and `"Prata"`. To load them from the Google Fonts service instead, switch to `next/font/google` (needs internet at build time); not done because it adds a network dependency.
- **P5 approved** by the user in the same message (cart, wishlist, compare).
- **Decided by:** User (colors, P5, docs folder); Claude (accessibility gate wording, font verification).

### D-034 · 2026-10-19 · P2 · APPROVED — Shop mega menu and restyled dropdowns
- **User request:** replace the Shop dropdown with the mega menu from the Figma frames "Mega menu" (`3:1452`) and "Menu dropdown" (`3:1749`).
- **Built:** a full-width panel under the header (BG-Body, dashed top edge) with three link columns (**Shop pages**, **Shop details**, **Shop essentials**; HOT red / NEW green badges), two promo cards (**Best seller**, **New arrival**, photos from Figma) and the page behind it dimmed. The other menus (Home, Categories, Pages, Journal) use the compact dropdown style from the design (270 px panel, dashed top edge, 37 px rows). Opens on hover and keyboard focus (CSS only; menu items stretch to the bottom of the header row so the pointer never drops between link and panel). The same menus are used in the Home header. Current page gets `aria-current="page"` (small client component `NavLink`).
- **Content lives in `src/config/navigation.ts`** (one place to edit labels, badges, links and promos).
- **Important limitation:** most entries in "Shop pages" and "Shop details" are *theme layout variants* that do not exist as pages (grid left sidebar, list right sidebar, gallery 2 column, inner zoom, ...; PRD OQ-06). They are shown exactly as designed but link to the nearest working page (`/shop` or the serum page) and are flagged `built: false` in the config. Real targets: Shop default, Out of stock, promos. Links to Cart, Wishlist, Checkout, My account, Order track, Compare, Store locator and Privacy policy point to pages that arrive in later phases and return the 404 page until then.
- **Revisit when:** the client decides which layout variants to ship (OQ-06): remove the others from the config, or build them.
- **Watch-out:** rules like `.nav ul` in a header stylesheet also match lists inside the panel; scope with `.nav > ul` (this broke the Home mega menu once).
- **Decided by:** User (request); Claude (implementation).

### D-035 · 2026-10-19 · P4 · APPROVED — Home page pixel-fidelity pass (Figma 3:2290)
- **User request:** "verify the home page perfectly matches the Figma file ... 100% pixel-perfect ... only the frontend".
- **Method:** the Home frame was exported at 1x (1920 x 10025, saved as `tests/visual/references/home-figma.png`, a working reference that is not shipped) and compared with a full-page capture of `/` at 1920 wide using `tests/visual/{capture,diff,shift,zoom,sidebyside,diffmap,bands,measure-home}.mjs`. Every section was fetched with `get_design_context`, rebuilt on the design's coordinates and re-measured until text/boxes land on the design's pixels. Text is placed by cap height with CSS `text-box: trim-both cap alphabetic` (same model as Figma's text-box trim).
- **Result (1920 wide, Chromium):** page height 10025 = design 10025; mean absolute difference 1.72 / 255 over the whole page. Remaining difference is text anti-aliasing, the three *hover* states the design draws statically (category card 2 tag + arrow, trending card 2 action column, Instagram tile 3 veil) and the header badges "2 / 2" (they show live counts once cart/wishlist exist, P5).
- **Built to the design:** header (dashed rule, 15px menu, exact icons, search field), announcement bar ornaments, hero (cap-placed copy, glass card, 20% badge, arrows, 01/02/03 index, top/bottom fades), category cards (exact fill crops, glass captions), marquee (seal icon, starts 257px off-screen), trending cards (exact star strip, glass actions), Fresh drops (badge, fade, 3 side cards), feature strip (design icons, dashed grid), editorial banner (contour texture, Allura script tag), Most loved cards, flash sale (luminosity blend, 98px timer boxes), Made personal cards, Explore bundle, journal, Instagram strip, footer (dashed grid, payments, B Corp).
- **Icons:** `Icon` stroke default is now 2 on the 24 grid (= the design's 1.5px at 18px); search/user/heart/bag/map-pin use the Figma geometry; arrow-up-right is the right arrow turned 45 degrees.
- **Fonts added:** Allura (Google font, `@fontsource/allura`) for the handwritten tag in the editorial banner.
- **Data decisions (Assumptions):** (a) Home cards show the design's sample values ($96 / $110, 5 stars, [30], custom tags such as "#Best seller") through banner slots `home-trending`, `home-loved`, `home-fresh-items` that link to the real products; the Shop and product pages keep the catalogue's own prices. (b) The design shows hero slide indexes 01/02/03 but only designs slide 1, so slides 2 and 3 repeat it until the client supplies copy. (c) The marquee lists the four designed promises (the earlier "Dermatologist tested" item is not in the design). (d) The Home footer newsletter has no consent checkbox because the design has none; the standard footer keeps it. **Open question for the client:** is implied consent acceptable for the Home newsletter box?
- **Known limits:** 1x Figma exports (retina softness), hover states are implemented as hover (not static), counts badges absent until P5, mobile/tablet not designed (P11), Firefox/WebKit untested.
- **Decided by:** User (request); Claude (implementation).

### D-036 · 2026-10-19 · P5 · APPROVED — Cart, wishlist and compare
- **Cart storage (CRT-004):** server-side in SQLite (`carts`, `cart_items`, migration 0004). A guest is identified by an unguessable 128-bit token in an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie `cart_token` (30 days; Secure in production). No cart data lives in the browser. The cart is read per request (root layout), so counts are correct on first paint. Guest-to-account merge (OQ-20, sum quantities) is built in P6.
- **Stock rules (CRT-005, BR-10):** on every add or quantity change the server compares the wanted quantity with `onHand - reserved` and rejects with 409 `stock_limit` / `out_of_stock`; 422 for non-integer, zero or more than 20 per line (`MAX_LINE_QUANTITY`); 404 for unknown or unpublished products. Prices and stock shown in the cart are always read live from the catalog, never stored on the line. Checkout (P6) re-validates again.
- **API:** `GET/DELETE /api/cart`, `POST /api/cart/items {slug|variantId, quantity}`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/cart/items/[variantId]`, `GET /api/products/lookup?slugs=` (wishlist and compare data). Errors use the common `{code,message}` shape.
- **Wishlist and compare (WSH-003, CMP-001):** guest lists of product slugs in `localStorage` (keys `cosmia.wishlist.v1`, `cosmia.compare.v1`), synced between tabs. The wishlist moves to the server when accounts exist (P6). Compare limit 4 (OQ-10 default, `src/config/store.ts`).
- **UI from the design:** cart drawer (3:15424 filled, 3:15067 empty), cart page + empty state with "Undo?" bar (3:20299, 3:29452), wishlist page (3:20784), compare page (3:21520), wishlist popup (3:15517) opened when a heart is added, "Already added" compare popup (3:15903). Header counts are live; the header bag opens the drawer (still links to /cart without scripts). Cards, the product page, Home (Fresh drops, Most loved, bundle) are wired.
- **Provisional rules (Assumptions, confirm later):** free-shipping threshold $100 (OQ-04 conflict $100/$50, stub in `src/config/store.ts`); "Buy now" adds the item and opens the cart page until checkout exists (P6); coupon box always answers "not valid" (rules arrive with discounts in P9); Cart total equals the subtotal (shipping and tax are decided at checkout, OQ-04); the Home bundle adds its three products at catalogue prices, which differ from the design's sample prices.
- **Not built:** wishlist share buttons are links to nowhere (design shows icons only); compare table omits the design's duplicated second PRICE row; responsive layouts below 1100 px are basic (P11).
- **Decided by:** User (approval of P5); Claude (implementation).

### D-037 · 2026-10-20 · P6 · APPROVED — Accounts, checkout, orders and tracking
- **Approval:** the user asked to start P6 ("start the dev server and start P6"). Prerequisites OQ-04, OQ-05, OQ-09, OQ-21 were not answered individually, so the defaults of D-004 apply and are listed below as Assumptions.
- **Data (migration 0005):** `users`, `sessions`, `password_resets`, `rate_limits`, `addresses`, `wishlist_items`, `orders`, `order_items`, `payments`, `order_events`, `email_outbox`, and `carts.user_id`. Money is integer cents. Order items copy name, size, SKU, image and price at purchase, so later catalog edits never rewrite an order. Plain constants (statuses, payment methods) live in `src/config/order-constants.ts` so the browser can import them without Drizzle.
- **Passwords and sessions (USR-001/002/005, SEC-001):** `scrypt` from `node:crypto` (N=16384, r=8, p=1, 16-byte salt, hash string carries its own cost) instead of argon2/bcrypt, because it is memory-hard, needs no native build on Windows and can be re-tuned without a migration. Policy: 8-200 characters and not in a small common-password list. A random 256-bit session token is sent in an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie (`Secure` in production) and **only its SHA-256 hash is stored**. Sessions last 1 day, 30 days with "Remember me". Logout deletes the row, so a copied cookie stops working. A password reset ends every session of that user.
- **Throttling (SEC-004):** `rate_limits` fixed-window counters in the database. Login: 5 failures per identifier per 15 minutes, then "locked" even for the correct password; success clears the counter. Forgot password: 5 per identifier per hour. Tracking: 10 per client address and 10 per order ID per 15 minutes. Password change: 5 per 15 minutes. The client address comes from `X-Forwarded-For` when present and valid, otherwise one shared "local" bucket (fine on localhost; a real deployment must sit behind a trusted proxy - see Open questions).
- **No enumeration:** wrong user and wrong password return the same 401 text and the password is hashed even for an unknown user (constant-ish timing). Forgot password always returns the same message. Tracking returns one "not found" for a wrong ID, a wrong email or a malformed ID. Registration does tell the shopper that an email or user name is taken (normal for sign-up forms).
- **CSRF (SEC-004):** all mutating routes call `crossSiteBlock` (an `Origin` header that does not match `Host` gets 403) on top of SameSite=Lax cookies.
- **Authorization on the server (SEC-002):** `requireUser` / `requireAdmin` guards for API routes, `getCurrentUser` for pages. Every `/account/**` page runs the check in its layout; an account only ever reads rows filtered by its own `user_id` (another account's order or address is "not found"). `requireAdmin` exists now and is first used by the admin routes in P7+.
- **Guest to account merge (OQ-20, CRT-004, WSH-003):** at login or registration the guest cart becomes the account cart, or its lines are summed into an existing account cart, capped by stock and the 20-per-line maximum; the cart cookie is re-pointed to the account cart. The browser wishlist is merged into `wishlist_items` and the merged list comes back to the browser; while signed in every heart change is pushed with `PUT /api/account/wishlist`, and the list is re-read from the server on page load. Logout empties the local wishlist and forgets the cart cookie so the next person on a shared computer sees neither. **Guest orders are not attached to an account by email** (no email verification exists, so that would let anyone read another person's orders).
- **Checkout (CHK-001..009):** `POST /api/checkout` validates with the shared Zod schema (`src/lib/validation/checkout.ts`, also used by the form), rebuilds everything from the server cart (prices and stock are never taken from the browser) and calls `placeOrder`. Guest and signed-in checkout are both allowed (OQ-09 default). A one-time idempotency key per checkout screen makes a double click or a replayed request return the first order (unique index on `orders.idempotency_key`, status 200 instead of 201). The order is created in one transaction (order, items, pending payment, first event, stock reservation by a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE on_hand - reserved >= qty`, so two buyers cannot both take the last unit); if any line cannot be reserved the whole transaction rolls back and the response lists the items ("stock_changed").
- **Stock model (BR-05):** placing an order raises `inventory.reserved`; `onHand` is unchanged, so "available" (`onHand - reserved`) drops immediately. Cancelling or a failed payment gives the reservation back; shipping commits it (`onHand` and `reserved` both drop). This matches the cart rule of D-036.
- **Payments (BR-07, OQ-05):** `PaymentGateway` interface with a `LocalGateway`. Bank transfer, cash on delivery and check payments (the three the design shows) stay `pending` until staff mark them paid (`markPaid`, used by the P8 admin). A fourth method, **test card**, approves immediately and is **off by default**: it appears only when the `PAYMENT_METHODS` environment variable lists `card_test` (the E2E run does), and its decline switch works only when `ALLOW_PAYMENT_SIMULATION=1` is set (the E2E run sets it on its production build; never set it on a real deployment). The server refuses a payment method that is not enabled. A declined or failing payment marks the order `failed`, releases the stock, records the reason on the payment row and **keeps the cart**, so the shopper can retry with a fresh key.
- **Order state machine (ORD-001, BR-06):** `pending -> processing | cancelled | failed`, `processing -> shipped | cancelled | refunded`, `shipped -> delivered | refunded`, `delivered -> refunded`; cancelled, refunded and failed are terminal. Every change writes an `order_events` row with actor and time. Order IDs are `CSM-` plus 8 characters from an alphabet without look-alikes (OQ-21 default).
- **Totals (BR-03, OQ-04 default):** shipping is a flat $8.00 below the free-shipping threshold ($100) and free at or above it, the same for every listed country, no tax (`src/config/store.ts`, `src/lib/totals.ts`). The design draws only Subtotal and Total (its sample basket is above the threshold), so a Shipping row is shown only when it is above zero. Countries offered: UK, US, Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden (placeholder list, Assumption).
- **Emails (USR-003, CHK-007):** no provider. `queueEmail` writes to `email_outbox`; the password-reset link and the order confirmation live there. Only the one-time link the recipient needs is put in a message.
- **Order access without an account:** the confirmation page (`/checkout/confirmation/[number]`) opens only for the browser that placed the order (httpOnly cookie `last_order`, 1 day) or the signed-in owner; anyone else is redirected to the tracking form. Tracking needs the order ID **and** the billing email (BR-12).
- **UI from the design:** login `3:22750` and register `3:23089` (one card with LOGIN/REGISTER tabs), lost password `3:23424`, checkout `3:22268`, order tracking `3:23740`. **Proposed (no frame exists):** reset-password page, order confirmation, tracking result and timeline, the account area (dashboard with change password, orders, order detail, addresses). They reuse the design's language (dashed Border Light cards, BG-Light-01 panels, cap-trimmed uppercase labels).
- **Fidelity method:** each frame was fetched with `get_design_context`, built on its coordinates and measured in page coordinates with `tests/visual/p6-shots.mjs` (prints measured boxes next to the Figma numbers). Result at 1920 wide: every checkout billing field, the coupon bar and form, the free-shipping box, the order panel top, line items, subtotal/total, payment methods, privacy text, terms box and the secure box are within 1 px of the design; the login card, tabs and fields are within 1 px. The Figma checkout frame is drawn with the coupon form open, so it is collapsed by default here ("Click here" opens it) and measured open.
- **Shared change:** the site header is now 110 px tall with its 1 px rule drawn over the first row of the page hero (it was 111 px, which pushed every inner page 1 px below the design). The Home header is unaffected.
- **Provisional (Assumptions to confirm):** $8 flat shipping and the country list; bank transfer/COD/check copy for COD and check (only bank transfer has design text); three offline methods enabled by default, test card hidden; guest checkout allowed; coupons still answer "not valid" until P9; the account area, confirmation page and tracking result are proposed designs; "Buy now" now goes straight to `/checkout`.
- **Not built / deferred:** email verification, 2FA, social login, "Remember me" changes nothing but the cookie lifetime, account email/username editing, customer-initiated cancellation, real carriers and tracking links (staff enter carrier and number in P8), refunds through a gateway, order PDF/invoice, privacy/terms pages (links go to `/policy/*`, built in P10), responsive layouts below 1100 px (P11).
- **Decided by:** User (start P6); Claude (implementation and the defaults above).
- **Evidence (2026-10-20):** typecheck, lint, format clean; Vitest 106/106 (41 new: auth, throttling, sessions, reset, cart/wishlist merge, order placement, idempotency, rollback, payments, state machine, stock, tracking); Playwright 89/89 (25 new: E2E-USR-01..07, E2E-CHK-01..09, E2E-TRK-01..04, E2E-A11Y-04 plus 4 new a11y routes). First run had 9 failures, all fixed: check box icon intercepted clicks, `data-done` rendered as "true", decline switch was disabled on the production build, a wishlist popup close click, two test expectations (product name case, payment reference text missing on the confirmation page - a real gap, now shown), and account pages threw when signed out (now redirect via `requireAccountUser`). Not verified: Firefox/WebKit, viewports below 1920, pixel diff against exported Figma PNGs for P6 pages (geometry measured numerically instead), the confirmation/tracking/account proposed designs have no Figma to compare.

### D-038 · 2026-10-20 · P4b · APPROVED — Product page layouts (the 11 Figma frames of the "Product details" group)
- **Approval:** the user supplied a screenshot of the Figma product-page frames and asked to develop them ("develop the pages from Figma"). This reverses the OQ-06 default of shipping one layout per route for the product page: all of them are built, and the admin chooses per product later. The admin comes after (the user said they will move to the dashboard later).
- **Scope:** Details default (already built in P4), Product color `3:34650`, Subscribe and save `3:35806`, On sale countdown `3:36996`, Thumbnail right `3:29779`, Thumbnail left `3:30941`, Gallery 1 column `3:33384`, Gallery 2 column `3:32103`, Inner zoom `3:17692`, External zoom `3:18997`. Out of stock `3:16432` is a state of every layout (already built, verified on three of the new layouts).
- **Selection (PRD-012):** one route, one data model. The layout is `?layout=<id>` in the URL (preview, any visitor), otherwise `products.pdp_layout` (new nullable column, migration 0006; unknown values are ignored), otherwise "details-default". Ids and the gallery/zoom setup per layout are in `src/lib/pdp-layouts.ts`. The admin control for the column arrives with the product screens (P8).
- **Gallery (`ProductGallery`):** modes `below` (645 x 752 image, 80 x 92 thumbs), `thumbs-start`/`thumbs-end` (80 px column beside a 550 x 642 image, 15 px gaps), `grid-1` (3 images of 645 x 751, 17 px gaps) and `grid-2` (2 x 2 cells of 314.5 x 367). The grids show the number of images drawn in the frames and a full-screen button opens the viewer, which now has next/previous and reaches all images.
- **Naming note (open question):** in the frames, "Thumbnail right" draws the thumbnail column on the LEFT of the image and "Thumbnail left" draws it on the RIGHT. The build copies the drawings and keeps the frame names as ids. If the client meant the opposite, only the mapping in `GALLERY_FOR` changes.
- **Zoom (mouse only, not on touch):** inner zoom is a 174 px round magnifier (2x) that follows the pointer; external zoom is a grey 174 px lens plus a 644 x image-height pane (2.4x, clamped to the image) drawn over the purchase panel at x=976..1620, as in the frame. Both are copies of the main image scaled around the pointer, so they always match what is under it. Keyboard and touch users keep the full-screen viewer. The pane is hidden below 1100 px.
- **Sale countdown (PRD-011, APM-002):** `products.sale_ends_at` (new, nullable). The countdown shows only when the layout is on, the product has a compare-at price and the end is in the future; it is seeded as +20 days for every product that has a compare-at price (demo data) and computed from the server clock handed to the page, so a wrong device clock cannot change it. The struck compare-at price comes first and a "SAVE n%" badge is computed from the real prices (the frame's 18% is placeholder copy). **Not done:** the price does not revert by itself when the sale ends (that needs the sale rules of P9); the timer simply disappears.
- **Subscribe and save (PRD-010):** UI built from the frame (two cards, "SAVE" badge, 15% and "every 60 days" in `src/config/store.ts`, price rounded to whole cents). There is no recurring-order backend, so choosing the subscription shows a note and disables Add to cart and Buy now; the one-time option works normally. **Assumption:** 15% and 60 days are the design's placeholder values.
- **Product color:** round chips with a name tooltip from the existing `colors`/`product_colors` data, shown only on products that have colors (e.g. velvet-skin-foundation, luxe-matte-lipstick). The selection is shown on the page only; it is not stored on the cart line or the order, because colors are not variants in the data model (open question for the client: should a colour be a sellable variant with its own SKU and stock?).
- **Lower page sections:** the layout frames differ from the default frame only in the top section (the lower content blocks are the same design); all layouts reuse the same lower sections.
- **Fidelity:** geometry measured in page coordinates with `tests/visual/pdp-shots.mjs`: gallery column x=300 y=187 (the product page top was 3 px low and is fixed), thumbnail layouts 550 x 642 with an 80 px column, gallery 1 column 645 x 2287, external pane x=976 w=644, subscribe cards 88 px tall with 10 px gaps. Each frame's top group was compared side by side with a capture. Not compared: pixel diff against exported Figma PNGs (only numeric checks and side-by-side views).
- **Tests (2026-10-20):** Vitest 111/111 (5 new, `tests/integration/pdp-layouts.test.ts`); Playwright 101/101 (12 new, `E2E-LAY-01..12` in `tests/e2e/storefront/product-layouts.spec.ts`: geometry of every layout, URL/product layout selection, thumbnails and arrows, viewer, both zooms, colour chips, subscribe rules, live countdown and its end, out of stock, axe on six layouts). Typecheck, lint and format clean. A full run takes about 4 minutes.
- **Not built:** quick view, size-guide modal and share modal (PRD-009/013..015, still COULD), responsive behaviour of the zoom and grids below 1100 px (P11), per-layout variants of the lower sections (none exist in the frames).
- **Decided by:** User (develop these pages); Claude (implementation, the selection mechanism and the defaults above).

### D-039 · 2026-10-20 · P2 · APPROVED — Home menu item is a plain link
- **Change (user request, screenshot):** the "Home" item in the header (both the Home header and the standard header) no longer has a chevron or a dropdown panel with a single "Home" entry; it is a plain link to `/` on every page. The Figma frames draw a chevron next to Home; the user's instruction overrides the drawing. `HOME_LINKS` was removed from `src/config/navigation.ts`.
- **Related:** the Shop mega menu column "Shop details" now links the product layouts that exist since D-038 (`/product/the-renewal-serum?layout=<id>`, flagged built); only "Sticky add to card" remains a design-only entry.
- **Decided by:** User; Claude (implementation).

### D-040 · 2026-10-20 · P10 · APPROVED — Policy pages (first content page, Figma 3:24059)
- **Approval:** the user asked to "move to next page from figma"; P10 (content pages) starts with the first frame of the Content group, "Policy and privacy". The other content frames (Store location `3:24455`, blog `3:25805` family + details `3:26684`, About `3:28603`, Contact `3:27227`, FAQs `3:27601`/`3:28374`, newsletter popup `3:2009`) are not started.
- **Route and data:** `/policy/[slug]` renders `src/content/policies.ts` through one template (`PolicyPage`): privacy (all text and layout from the design), plus shipping, returns and terms because the footer, checkout and newsletter already link to them. An unknown slug is a 404. The data will move to the database "pages" table with the admin (P9).
- **Content sources:** privacy is the design's text. Shipping figures come from `src/config/store.ts` (so the page cannot disagree with checkout) and the delivery countries from the checkout list. Returns repeats the "returns within 15 days on eligible, unopened products" of the design's benefit card. **Terms is a stub that says the store owner must complete it**; no legal text was invented. Support emails (`support@cosmia.com`) are Assumptions; `privacy@cosmia.com` is the design's.
- **Template details from the frame:** 405 px "On this page" list (sticky), numbered entries including "Contact us" (the contact box is its sixth entry), the section being read is underlined (scroll-position based; a click keeps its entry selected until the reader uses wheel/touch/keys); 855 px text column; h2 32/50 with a dashed rule; bullet and numbered lists, a note with a 3 px Secondary left border, a two-column dashed table, a contact box; "Last updated" in US long form.
- **Fidelity:** text placed by cap height (`text-box: trim-both cap alphabetic`) and measured with `tests/visual/content-shots.mjs`: headings 1, 2, 4, 5 within 1 px, heading 3 within 4 px, contents box, note box, contact box within 2 px, total height 3909 vs 3906. The design spaces section 2's rule 5 px lower than the other sections (hand-placed); the build keeps one consistent rhythm.
- **Shared chrome corrected to the frame (affects every inner page):** the benefit strip is now 468 px tall (its two texts are cap-trimmed, 25 px between title and text; it was 483 px) and the footer 659 px (the space under the link columns is 135 px; it was 624 px). The Home footer is a separate component and was not changed.
- **Also:** the newsletter terms link now uses `next/link` (lint).
- **Tests:** Playwright 106/106 (4 new, `E2E-CNT-01..04`: structure and geometry, contents list behaviour including scroll up/down, shipping/returns/terms content, 404 and all footer policy links resolve; `/policy/privacy` added to axe). Vitest 111/111. Full run about 4 minutes.
- **Decided by:** User (next page); Claude (implementation, placeholder content flagged above).

### D-041 · 2026-10-20 · P10 · APPROVED — Store location, About us, Contact us, FAQs and the 404 page
- **Approval:** the user answered "I want all of that" to the list of remaining content pages (Store location, blog, About us, Contact us, FAQs, newsletter popup). Frames: Store location `3:24455`, About us `3:28603`, Contact us `3:27227`, FAQs `3:27601`. Frame `3:28374`, named "FAQs (second frame)" in the file, is in fact the **404 page** ("Oooop! Page not found"), which closes the PRD note on CNT-004.
- **Store location (`/store-locator`):** `src/content/stores.ts` (3 sample stores from the design), `src/lib/store-status.ts` (Open/Closed from the opening hours in the store's own time zone, tested), map image beside the list. Distance is left empty (OQ-22 default: static list, no geolocation). Header top bar and footer "Online" already link here.
- **About us (`/about`):** copy taken verbatim from the design, including its typos ("Reasone to chose us"), kept so the page can be compared with Figma; the client should correct them. The hero has no banner image (as in the frame). The call-to-action targets are Assumptions: Shop bestseller → `/shop?badge=best-seller`, Read our science → `/blog`, Meet our suppliers → `/contact`.
- **Contact us (`/contact`):** four contact cards, the map, the message form and "Common questions". `POST /api/contact` validates (zod), stores the message in `contact_messages` (migration 0007) with status `new`, and limits to 5 per hour per client address and per email. **No email is sent** (local phase). The list of topics (Order support, Product advice, Returns and exchanges, Wholesale and stockists, Press, Something else) is an **Assumption**: the design shows only the placeholder "Chose a topic".
- **FAQs (`/faqs`):** four topics × four questions, a search that filters questions and answers, a topic list that follows the scroll position, and the "Still stuck?" card. Only the shipping answers rest on store rules; **every other answer is an Assumption** written to agree with the store settings, and the client must replace them. New icons (`package`, `mortar`, `user-circle`) are hand-drawn approximations of the design's.
- **404:** `not-found.tsx` uses the design (heading, text, "Go back to home").
- **None of these pages has a benefit strip** (none in the frames); the footer follows the last section.
- **Fidelity:** measured with `tests/visual/*-shots.mjs`; boxes within about 1–2 px, except the FAQs second section, 25 px shorter because the placeholder answer is shorter.
- **Tests:** `E2E-CNT-05..11` (store list and open/closed, About, Contact cards and form including storage and the rate limit, FAQs accordion and search, 404); Vitest `store-status` (3).
- **Decided by:** User (scope); Claude (implementation, assumptions flagged above).

### D-042 · 2026-10-20 · P10 · APPROVED — Blog: list in five layouts, post page, comments
- **Frames:** grid `3:25805`, left sidebar `3:28943`, right sidebar `3:24811`, list `3:25320`, standard `3:26239`, post `3:26684`. OQ-06 (which layout is the default) is answered by the grid, which is the first frame; the other four are available through `/blog?layout=list|standard|sidebar-left|sidebar-right` and from the "Journal" menu, like the product layouts (D-038).
- **Data:** tables `blog_posts` and `blog_comments` (migration 0008). `content` is a JSON list of blocks (paragraph, check list, quote, image pair, note) so the admin can edit articles later. The seed holds the 12 posts of the design with their images (compressed into `public/images/blog/`), all dated 08 Oct 2026 as in the design, plus the three comments shown under the first post.
- **Article text is an Assumption:** only the first post has a designed body. The other 11 reuse it until real articles exist.
- **List behaviour:** 12 posts per page in the grid, 8 in the sidebar grids, 6 in the list, 3 in the standard layout (as each frame shows them); `?page=`, `?category=`, `?tag=`, `?q=` (search in title, excerpt and category; wildcard characters are literal). Pagination appears only when there is more than one page, so the 12-post grid shows none; the frame shows three pages, which implies more posts than the design lists.
- **Sidebar:** search, the "Mid year sale" banner (code GLOW30 is design text, not an active discount), the six biggest categories with counts (the design's categories are hotel placeholders), the three newest posts (not the open one) and up to nine tags. The first category is highlighted until a filter is chosen.
- **Previous/next post** follow list order and wrap around, so both links always exist (the design shows both).
- **Comments (`POST /api/blog/[slug]/comments`):** validated, stored as `pending`, shown only after staff approve them (admin, P9; **moderation is an Assumption**, chosen so the public cannot publish text without review). 5 per hour per client address and per email. A reply must point at an approved comment of the same post. The "02 Comments" count is the number of top-level threads, as in the design.
- **Fidelity:** measured with `tests/visual/blog-shots.mjs`: cards, rows, images, sidebar widgets and the post column are within 1–2 px of the frames (post page 5062 px against 5060; list 3399 = 3399). The standard layout is 48 px shorter than its frame because the sample excerpts are one line, not two.
- **Tests:** `E2E-BLG-01..05`, Vitest `blog` (8), a11y routes `/blog`, `/blog?layout=list`, a post.
- **Decided by:** User (scope); Claude (implementation, assumptions flagged above).

### D-043 · 2026-10-20 · P10 · APPROVED — Newsletter sign-up and the welcome popup (Figma 3:2009)
- **Data and API:** table `newsletter_subscribers` (migration 0009; email unique and lower-cased, source `footer|home-footer|popup`, consent time, unsubscribed time). `POST /api/newsletter` requires `consent: true`, limits to 10 per hour per client address, and answers a repeated address exactly like a new one (no way to learn who is subscribed). An address that had unsubscribed is re-activated with a new consent time.
- **Forms:** both footer forms now store the address (before this they only validated). The standard footer keeps its terms checkbox. The Home footer (no checkbox in the design, D-035) treats pressing Subscribe as consent — an **Assumption** the client should confirm.
- **Popup:** appears 6 seconds after a page opens, not on cart, checkout or sign-in pages; closing it keeps it away for 7 days, subscribing for good (browser local storage). Escape, the X and a click on the dark area close it; focus moves into it and stays inside. The design's note ("*Receive curated updates…") is the consent text. **Timing, frequency and the pages are Assumptions.**
- **The 20% offer (OQ-23 default):** no code is issued or promised; the thank-you text says a welcome offer will arrive by email, and no email is sent locally. The code is created manually in the admin (P8).
- **E2E setup:** `playwright.config.ts` starts every test as a visitor who already closed the popup; `storefront/newsletter.spec.ts` starts from an empty browser.
- **Tests:** `E2E-NWS-01..03`, Vitest `newsletter` (4).
- **Decided by:** User (scope); Claude (implementation, assumptions flagged above).

### D-044 · 2026-10-20 · P10 · APPROVED — Answers to the open questions on the content pages
- **Approval:** the user answered the six questions raised after D-041..D-043.
- **Blog article text (D-042):** "same thing": the 11 other posts keep reusing the designed article until real articles are written.
- **FAQ answers and contact topics (D-041):** the user will update them later; they stay Assumptions until then.
- **About typos (D-041):** corrected ("Reasons to choose us", "effective", "patch testing", "specialists to keep", a double space, a missing space), because Figma remains the reference for the original wording.
- **Comment moderation (D-042):** confirmed; new comments stay pending until approved in the admin (P9).
- **Home footer consent (D-043):** the user left it to Claude ("best practice"). Newsletter consent should be an explicit action, so a checkbox ("Agree to our Terms & Condition?") was added under the Home footer field, like the standard footer; without it the form shows "Please accept the terms to subscribe." This is a deliberate small departure from the frame, which has no checkbox. The popup keeps its note as consent text because the frame has no room for a checkbox; revisit if the client wants a checkbox there too.
- **Welcome offer (D-043):** confirmed: no code is issued automatically; staff create it in the admin (P8).
- **Tests:** `E2E-STO-02` extended (consent required on the Home footer); Home, content-pages and newsletter specs 22/22.
- **Decided by:** User (answers); Claude (consent checkbox, per "decide for me").

### D-045 · 2026-10-20 · P4c · APPROVED — The ten Shop listing layouts (closes PRD OQ-06 for the shop)
- **Approval:** the user said "Yes, start the shop layout" for the nine remaining listing frames. Frames: right sidebar `3:40462`, list left `3:38190`, list right `3:39326`, load more `3:5980`, top filter `3:7112`, list top filter `3:8330`, horizontal filter `3:10357`, list horizontal `3:9418`, filter drawer `3:11424` (left sidebar `3:4833` already existed).
- **Selection:** `?layout=left|right|list-left|list-right|load-more|top-filter|list-top-filter|horizontal|list-horizontal|filter-drawer` (default `left`; unknown values fall back to it). The layout is part of the catalog query (`query.layout`, `src/lib/shop-layouts.ts`) so every filter, sort, page and "Clear all" link keeps it. It never changes which products match, so the API and the counts are untouched. The mega menu's Shop pages list now links to the nine layouts.
- **Grid/list switch:** the 81 × 44 toggle left of "Showing …" (new in all layouts, it was missing) moves between the grid and list form of the same filter placement (left ↔ list-left, right ↔ list-right, top ↔ list-top, horizontal ↔ list-horizontal); Load more and Filter drawer switch to list-left (the design has no list form of them).
- **List rows:** `ProductCard layout="row"` (982 × 359: image 308 wide, rating, name, label, description, dark "Shop now" button, price). The description is the product's short description (`ProductSummary.description`); the design repeats one long sample text, so rows with short descriptions are shorter than the frame's three lines.
- **Filters in four places** from one component (`FilterSidebar variant`): sidebar (left or right); panel of five columns under the toolbar, open at first with a FILTER button (Categories and Color scroll; Availability is not in the panel, as in the frame); a bar of five dropdowns (one open at a time, Escape/outside click close; 60 px between bar and chips as in the frame); a 368 px drawer from the left over a dimmed page (focus moves in, Escape/X/dimmed area close, page scroll locked). The open/closed state is shared through `FilterUiProvider`.
- **Load more:** a link that raises `pageSize` by 12 (up to the existing maximum of 48) and shows "Showing 1-24 of 36"; no page numbers. It works without JavaScript.
- **Page size:** the 4-column grids show 16 products (four full rows, as the frames do); every other layout 12. The size is implicit, so it does not appear in the URL.
- **Shared corrections found by measuring:** the applied-filter chips are 26 px tall (they were 37) and "Clear all" sits right after the chips (it was at the far right); the content column starts 28 px after the sidebar (it was 29). These affect the original left layout too.
- **Fidelity:** measured with `tests/visual/shop-shots.mjs` with one applied filter (the frames show chips): toolbar, toggle, filter button, panel, bar and popover boxes are exact; list rows, text offsets and buttons within 1 px; page heights within 1–12 px (the list frames place their third row 11 px lower than the others, which is not reproduced).
- **Not built:** the dropdown/panel/drawer filters below 1100 px are basic (P11); in the list layouts the "quick view" hover icons are the same as the grid card's.
- **Tests:** `E2E-SHP-01..07`, shop pages added to axe (list-left, top-filter, horizontal); `catalog.spec` unchanged and passing. Combined run of shop-layouts, catalog and a11y: 43/43.
- **Decided by:** User (scope); Claude (implementation, assumptions flagged above).

### D-046 · 2026-10-20 · P0 · APPROVED — Git repository and first push to GitHub (supersedes the "no Git" part of D-002)
- **Approval:** the user asked to "initialize Git locally first" and gave their own repository, `https://github.com/AlveeUX/beauty-ecommerce.git`, to push to.
- **Done:** `git init -b main`; first commit `ae7c5fc` (555 files); `origin` added; `main` pushed (the remote was empty, a plain push, no force).
- **Checks before the commit:** no secrets found (pattern scan for keys and tokens); only `.env.example` and `uploads/.gitkeep` of the env/upload files are tracked; databases, `.next`, `node_modules`, test output are ignored.
- **Not committed on purpose:** `tests/visual/baselines/` (53 MB of screenshots written by the `tests/visual/*.mjs` scripts; now in `.gitignore`, regenerate with the scripts). `tests/visual/references/` (the Figma export the diff scripts use, 8 MB) is committed.
- **Rules from now on:** commit locally when a piece of work is finished; **ask before every push**; never force-push or rewrite history. Deploying (Vercel etc.) is still not approved.
- **Decided by:** User.
