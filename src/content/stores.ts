 * Store locations (CNT-005, Figma 3:24455). Names, addresses and phone numbers are the design's sample data;
 * opening hours follow the design's "Closes 8:00 PM / 7:00 PM / Opens 10:00 AM" and are the same every day.
 * The design also shows a distance ("0.4 mi"); distances need the visitor's location, which the store
 * locator does not ask for (PRD OQ-22 default: static list), so `distance` stays empty until the client decides.
 * The admin "stores" screen (P9) will own this list.
