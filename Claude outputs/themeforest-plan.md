# ThemeForest Release Plan — Cosmia storefront

> Drop this file into `docs/themeforest-plan.md` and point Claude Code at it.
> It follows the project's own conventions (`CLAUDE.md`, `development-plan.md` §3 task contracts, decision log).
> Phase IDs use the prefix **TF** so they don't collide with P0–P12.
> Written 2026-10-20 against commit `ea92b0d` (57/57 Figma frames built, 149/149 Playwright tests passing).

> **FINAL version — 2026-10-20 13:00.** Supersedes the earlier draft. Save as `docs/themeforest-plan.md` in the ThemeForest copy.

## Current state (verified 2026-10-20)

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Original project | `C:\Projects\beauty-ecommerce` — untouched, stays the full-stack app |
| ThemeForest copy | `C:\Projects\themeforest-projects\tf-beauty-ecommerce` (629 files, same history as original at `ea92b0d`) |
| GitHub repo | `https://github.com/AlveeUX/tf-beauty-ecommerce.git` — full history pushed. **Repo is PUBLIC** (see TF0-T05: make it private now) |
| Envato account | `TreeTech_Themes`, author since Aug 2024, but `/upload` redirects to the dashboard and the menu still shows "Become an Author". Support ticket sent 2026-10-20 — **waiting** |
| Figma design ownership | **Unconfirmed** (TF0-T02) |
| `npm install` in the copy | **Fails** on `better-sqlite3` (no prebuilt binary for Node 24.18, no C++ build tools). Local-machine issue, not a repo problem. Fix in TF1-T00 below; the problem disappears for good once TF1-T09 removes the native module |
| Not started | TF0 answers, TF1–TF8 |

---

## 0. Decisions this plan is built on

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| TF-D1 | **Product = Next.js eCommerce front-end template with JSON mock data. No database, no server auth, no admin.** | Buyers expect a front end they connect to their own backend (Shopify headless, Medusa, Saleor, custom API). `better-sqlite3` is a native module that fails on most buyer hosts (Vercel, Netlify, shared hosting), and every failure becomes a support ticket during the 6-month support window. Reviewers score design, code quality, docs and the live preview — a backend adds review surface and no score. |
| TF-D2 | **Work happens on a `themeforest` branch. `main` stays the full-stack app.** | The backend (auth, orders, state machine, payments) keeps its value for client work or a later full-stack product. Nothing is thrown away. |
| TF-D3 | **P7–P9 (admin) are out of scope for the ThemeForest product.** P11 (responsive) becomes TF3. P12 becomes TF4–TF7. | The admin has no Figma design and no buyer value inside a template. |
| TF-D4 | **All layout variants ship as demos** (10 shop, 11 product, 6 blog). Replaces OQ-06 "ship one layout" for this branch. | On ThemeForest the variants are the selling point. They're already built. |
| TF-D5 | **Images: placeholders in the download zip; licensed photos only in the live preview.** All current Figma-sourced photos and product PNGs are removed from the zip. | Ownership of the Figma photos is unconfirmed (OQ-02). This is the standard marketplace pattern and removes the licensing risk from review. |
| TF-D6 | **Keep the service-function signatures; swap what's underneath.** `src/server/*` read functions keep their names and types but read JSON instead of SQLite. Write flows (cart, auth, checkout, reviews, contact, newsletter) move to client-side stores. | 64 files import `@/server` or `@/db`. Swapping under the services keeps page and component churn small. It also gives buyers one clean seam to plug in their own API — a selling point. |
| TF-D7 | **Deployment target: any Node host or Vercel/Netlify (`next build && next start`).** Static export is a stretch goal, not a requirement. | `/shop` filtering is URL-driven on the server (`searchParams`), which static export doesn't support without a rewrite. |

Log TF-D1…TF-D7 in `decision-log.md` as the next D-numbers when TF1 starts.

## 1. Phase overview

| Phase | Name | Effort | Blocks submission? |
|---|---|---|---|
| TF0 | Gates: account, design ownership, name | 1–3 days (mostly waiting) | **Yes** |
| TF1 | Branch + data-layer swap (remove DB/backend) | 4–6 days | Yes |
| TF2 | Demo hub + template polish | 2–3 days | Yes |
| TF3 | Responsive + accessibility | 6–9 days | **Yes — biggest risk** |
| TF4 | Quality bar: browsers, performance, code hygiene | 2–3 days | Yes |
| TF5 | Images, fonts, legal, credits | 2–3 days | Yes |
| TF6 | Buyer documentation | 2–3 days | Yes |
| TF7 | Packaging + live preview | 2 days | Yes |
| TF8 | Listing assets + submission + support setup | 2–3 days | — |

**Total: about 4–6 weeks.** TF0 runs in parallel with TF1–TF2. TF5 photo sourcing can run in parallel with TF3.

## 2. Phases

### TF0 — Gates

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | Confirm the item can legally and practically be sold on ThemeForest before investing further. |
| Tasks | **TF0-T01** Wait for Envato support reply on upload rights for TreeTech_Themes (ticket opened 2026-10-20). Do **not** click "Become an Author" unless support says to. · **TF0-T02** Confirm who designed the Figma file "Ecommerce (Copy)" (`sXBQCd1Az2To21ejk56Yjc`). If you or your team designed it → OK. If it was bought or copied (UI kit, Figma Community, another author) → read that licence; most UI-kit licences forbid reselling a coded version as a template. If not allowed → stop and redesign. · **TF0-T03** Envato author account: complete profile (avatar, bio), tax info, payout details, ID check. · **TF0-T04** Choose the product name. Brand first, item type stated, ≤100 characters, none of: Amazing, Awesome, Best, Bundle, Discount, Free, Premium, Pro, Ultimate. Example shape: `Cosmia – Skincare & Beauty eCommerce Next.js Template`. Check that "Cosmia" isn't already a registered beauty brand or an existing ThemeForest item. |
**TF0-T05 (do first, 1 minute)** Make `tf-beauty-ecommerce` **private**: GitHub → repo → Settings → General → Danger Zone → *Change visibility* → Private. The history contains Figma-sourced photos and product images you don't have confirmed rights to publish; while the repo is public they are being redistributed. Making it private stops further exposure but cannot un-publish what was already visible. If the photos turn out not to be yours to share, the clean fix is to delete the GitHub repo, run TF5-T01 on the copy, rewrite history without the photos (or start a fresh repo from a clean snapshot), and push again. Decide after TF0-T02.
**TF0-T06** Dependency hygiene: nothing else to do now; the install problem is handled in TF1-T00. |
| Completion criteria | Repo private; support confirms Site Templates (or Jamstack) upload rights; design ownership confirmed in writing; name chosen. |
| Exit gate | All four answers logged in `decision-log.md`. |
| If a gate fails | Upload rights refused → the same zip sells on your own store (Lemon Squeezy / Gumroad) or another marketplace; only TF8 changes. Design not yours → stop; this is not fixable by code. |

### TF1 — Branch and data-layer swap

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | The app builds and runs with **no database, no native modules, no server state**, with every page still rendering exactly as today. |
| Prerequisites | `main` clean and pushed (it is: `ea92b0d`). User approval to create the branch. |
| Tasks | **TF1-T00 Get a working baseline without installing native code.** The copy's `npm install` fails because `better-sqlite3` can't be built on this machine. Pick one: **(a) fastest, no changes to your system:** copy the original's already-working `node_modules` into the copy (`robocopy C:\Projects\beauty-ecommerce\node_modules C:\Projects\themeforest-projects\tf-beauty-ecommerce\node_modules /E /NFL /NDL`), then run `npm run build` and `npm test` to confirm the baseline. The lockfile is identical, so this is safe. **(b)** use Node 22 LTS (the project's `engines` says ≥22) via nvm-windows/fnm, then `npm install`. **(c)** install Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload) — large, changes the system, not recommended. After TF1-T09 deletes `better-sqlite3`, none of this matters. Run the baseline once, record it in the decision log, and move on. · **TF1-T01** `git switch -c themeforest` (in the copy, so `main` still mirrors the original). · **TF1-T02** Export the current seed (catalog, categories, variants, blog, content, stores, FAQs, reviews) to typed JSON in `src/data/*.json`, with Zod schemas in `src/data/schema.ts`. Write a one-off export script; don't hand-copy. · **TF1-T03** Create `src/data/provider.ts`: a `DataProvider` interface (getProducts, getProduct, getCategories, search, getPosts, …) and a `JsonProvider` implementation. Read-side functions in `src/server/catalog`, `blog`, `content`, `search` call the provider instead of Drizzle. Keep their signatures. · **TF1-T04** Cart → client store (`localStorage`, same shape as today's API responses). Wishlist/compare are already `localStorage`. · **TF1-T05** Checkout → client-side validation (keep the Zod schemas), "place order" writes a demo order to `localStorage` and routes to `/checkout/confirmation/[number]`. Payment methods shown, none charged. · **TF1-T06** Login / register / forgot / reset / account → demo mode: client validation, a demo session in `localStorage`, account pages read demo orders and addresses from `localStorage`. Add a small dismissible "Demo mode" note on these pages. · **TF1-T07** Track order → looks up `localStorage` orders plus one seeded sample order (documented in the docs). · **TF1-T08** Reviews, contact, newsletter → client validation + success state, no persistence. · **TF1-T09** Remove `src/db`, `drizzle/`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `scripts/db-*`, `scripts/test-reset.ts`, `data/`, `better-sqlite3`, `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `serverExternalPackages`, `/api/*` routes that are no longer called, `src/server/{auth,orders,payments,email,security,account}`. · **TF1-T10** Update `.env.example` (likely empty or removed), README, `CLAUDE.md` (branch rules). |
| E2E / tests | Rewrite DB-dependent tests: drop `tests/integration/db.test.ts` etc.; keep the 149 Playwright specs, changing only fixtures/setup (no `test:reset`). Add a unit test that every JSON file passes its Zod schema. |
| Completion criteria | `npm ci && npm run build && npm start` works on a clean clone with **no** `.env` and no DB. All pages render. `npm ls better-sqlite3` returns nothing. |
| Exit gate | typecheck, lint, Vitest, Playwright (Chromium) all pass; side-by-side screenshots of Home, Shop, PDP, Cart, Checkout unchanged vs `main`. |

### TF2 — Demo hub and template polish

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | A reviewer or buyer can find every variant in one click, and nothing looks like a dev artifact. |
| Tasks | **TF2-T01** Build a **Demos landing page** (e.g. `/demos`): cards for each shop layout (10), product layout (11), blog layout (6), key pages (cart, checkout, account, 404). This is also the source for preview screenshots. · **TF2-T02** Mega menu "Shop Pages" entries point at the real variant URLs (already mostly done, D-049) — verify none are placeholders. · **TF2-T03** `/dev/components` → either delete, or polish into a documented **UI Kit** page (buttons, inputs, badges, cards, modals). Recommendation: polish it — buyers value it. · **TF2-T04** Replace demo copy that contradicts itself (free-shipping $50 vs $100, multiple addresses, "2026" copyright) with consistent demo content stored in `src/data/site.json`. · **TF2-T05** Centralise brand settings (name, logo, colours, contact, socials, currency, free-shipping threshold) in one `src/config/site.ts` so buyers rebrand in one file. · **TF2-T06** Loading and error states (`loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`) for main routes. |
| Completion criteria | `/demos` lists every variant with a working link; no placeholder links anywhere in menus or footer. |
| Exit gate | A link-crawl E2E test (all internal links return 200) passes. |

### TF3 — Responsive and accessibility (biggest risk)

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | Every route works and looks deliberate at 1920, 1440, 1024, 768 and 390 px. |
| Prerequisites | TF1 done. |
| Tasks | **TF3-T01** Design mobile frames in Figma for the templates that set the patterns: Home, Shop (with filter drawer), Product, Cart, Checkout, Header/menu drawer, Footer. Everything else follows these patterns. If you skip Figma, write a responsive spec instead and approve it before coding. · **TF3-T02** Audit existing breakpoints (today: 34 rules at 1100 px, 9 at 700 px, a few one-offs) and consolidate to tokens: `--bp-xl 1440`, `--bp-lg 1024`, `--bp-md 768`, `--bp-sm 390`. · **TF3-T03** Header: logo + search + cart + hamburger; mega menu → accordion drawer. · **TF3-T04** Shop: sidebar → existing Filter Drawer pattern (`3:11424`); grid 4/3 → 2 → 2-compact. · **TF3-T05** Product page: gallery above info, swipeable thumbnails, sticky add-to-cart bar on mobile (exists — verify). · **TF3-T06** Cart table → stacked cards; checkout single column, summary collapsible. · **TF3-T07** Carousels swipeable with visible controls; modals full-screen on mobile. · **TF3-T08** Accessibility: keyboard walk-through of every overlay and menu; **fix the colour-contrast pairs accepted in D-033** (adjust the gray tokens slightly) — this replaces D-033 on this branch. |
| E2E / tests | Add the five viewports to the Playwright config as projects; run the full suite at each; axe at each with colour-contrast **included**. Visual baselines per viewport. |
| Completion criteria | No horizontal scroll at any viewport on any route; all journeys pass at all viewports; axe 0 critical/serious including contrast. |
| Exit gate | Responsive + a11y report recorded in the decision log. |

### TF4 — Quality bar

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | Pass a reviewer's technical check without comment. |
| Tasks | **TF4-T01** Playwright on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit (add projects). · **TF4-T02** Upgrade to the **latest public Next.js minor** (and React) at submission time; re-run everything. · **TF4-T03** Lighthouse on Home, Shop, PDP, Checkout (mobile + desktop): target Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, Best Practices ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 95. Fix image sizing (`next/image` sizes), font loading, CLS. · **TF4-T04** HTML validity check on rendered pages (W3C validator or `html-validate`). · **TF4-T05** Code hygiene: no `console.log`, no commented-out blocks, no TODOs, no unused files/exports (`knip` or `ts-prune`), consistent naming, comments where non-obvious. Remove `tests/visual/_dbg.mjs`, `_m2–_m4.mjs`, `_outline.py` style scratch files. · **TF4-T06** `npm audit` 0 high/critical; pin dependency versions. · **TF4-T07** Metadata: per-page `<title>`/description, Open Graph image, favicon set, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`. · **TF4-T08** Make sure the site can render inside an **iframe** (ThemeForest's live preview frames your demo): no `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and no `frame-ancestors 'none'` on the preview deploy. |
| Exit gate | All suites green on 3 browsers × 5 viewports; Lighthouse report saved; validator clean. |

### TF5 — Images, fonts, legal, credits

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | Nothing in the zip that you don't have the right to redistribute. |
| Tasks | **TF5-T01** Remove every Figma-sourced photo and product PNG from the zip build (`public/images/**` photos — about 150 files). · **TF5-T02** Generate placeholder images in code (neutral blocks in the theme palette with dimensions printed, correct aspect ratios) — a script, not AI image generation. · **TF5-T03** Source **preview** photos from Unsplash or Pexels (cosmetics, skincare, models, flat-lays). Record each: URL, photographer, licence, where used, in `CREDITS.md`. No AI-generated images anywhere in the zip. · **TF5-T04** Build flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_IMAGES=real|placeholder`; the preview deploy uses `real`, the packaged zip defaults to `placeholder`. Keep both image sets out of each other's build. · **TF5-T05** Fonts: Instrument Sans, Prata, Allura via `@fontsource` (SIL OFL 1.1) — include licence texts in `licenses/`. · **TF5-T06** Icons and logos: confirm the source of every SVG icon; payment logos (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, PayPal, Bitcoin) are acceptable as payment indicators — keep them unmodified; **remove the B Corp badge** (it's a certification mark; implying certification is misleading). Social icons: use official/brand-guideline shapes. · **TF5-T07** Third-party npm licences: generate a list (`license-checker`) into `licenses/THIRD-PARTY.txt`. · **TF5-T08** No author logo, URL, watermark or personal email anywhere in the item. |
| Exit gate | `CREDITS.md` complete; a grep of the zip build for `.jpg/.png` finds only placeholders + your own SVGs. |

### TF6 — Buyer documentation

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Objective | A buyer who has never seen the project installs, rebrands and deploys it from the docs alone. |
| Format | HTML (`documentation/index.html`, self-contained, English) — the conventional ThemeForest format. |
| Sections | 1 Introduction & features · 2 Requirements (Node ≥ 22, npm) · 3 Quick start (`npm install`, `npm run dev`) · 4 Folder structure · 5 Rebranding (`src/config/site.ts`, logo, fonts) · 6 Theming with design tokens (`src/styles/tokens.css`) · 7 Pages and demos (route list, how to choose a default shop/product/blog layout) · 8 Content (`src/data/*.json`: products, categories, blog, pages) · 9 **Connecting a real backend** (the `DataProvider` interface; example adapter outline for a REST API / headless commerce) · 10 Cart, checkout and accounts in demo mode (what they do, what to replace) · 11 Images (replacing placeholders) · 12 Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Node server) · 13 Accessibility & browser support · 14 Credits & licences · 15 Changelog · 16 FAQ & troubleshooting · 17 Support policy (what is/isn't covered, how to contact). |
| Exit gate | A fresh tester (or a fresh Claude Code session with only the zip + docs) completes quick start, a rebrand and a deploy without help. |

### TF7 — Packaging and live preview

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Tasks | **TF7-T01** `scripts/package-themeforest.mjs` builds the zip from an **allow-list** (not a deny-list): <br>`cosmia-nextjs-v1.0.0.zip` → `cosmia/` (theme source, folder named after the theme) · `documentation/` · `licenses/` · `CREDITS.md` · `changelog.txt`. <br>Excluded automatically: `.git`, `.next`, `node_modules`, `tests/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `data/`, `uploads/`, `docs/` (internal), `CLAUDE.md`, `.vercelignore`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, real photos. · **TF7-T02** Version 1.0.0 in `package.json`; `"private": true` stays; `"name"` = theme slug. · **TF7-T03** Clean-room test: unzip into an empty folder → `npm install` → `npm run build` → `npm start` → follow docs. Also on Windows and macOS/Linux if possible. · **TF7-T04** Live preview deploy (Vercel or your own server) on **your own domain**, real-photo build, `/demos` as entry. Needs explicit approval per `CLAUDE.md`. · **TF7-T05** Confirm the preview loads inside an iframe and over HTTPS. |
| Exit gate | Zip < 2 GB (expect < 20 MB), clean-room test passes, preview URL live. |

### TF8 — Listing, submission, support

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Tasks | **TF8-T01** Cover image: 3:2, **2340×1560** (minimum 1170×780), ≤ 20 MB, JPEG/PNG. Show the brand name, "Next.js", the hero, and a mobile frame. · **TF8-T02** Preview images: up to 15 — Home, Shop variants grid, PDP variants grid, Cart/Checkout, Account, Blog, mobile set, UI Kit. · **TF8-T03** Title (≤ 100 chars, brand first), description (features, tech, pages count, layout counts, "connect any backend", what's in the zip, credits note on placeholder images), tags (≤ 15), category (choose at upload — check where comparable Next.js eCommerce templates sit: Site Templates or Jamstack). · **TF8-T04** Price: look at 5–10 comparable Next.js eCommerce templates and price in their range; remember the 50% author fee. · **TF8-T05** Submit. Soft reject → fix every listed point and resubmit quickly. Hard reject → final for that item; read the reasons before building the next one. · **TF8-T06** Support: support email or channel, response target (e.g. 1–2 business days), support policy page (6 months included, customization and installation excluded), update cadence, changelog per release. |

## 3. What to stop / not do on the `themeforest` branch

- Don't start **P7 admin dashboard** (or P8/P9). If you want them for `main`, do them later on `main`.
- Don't push the `themeforest` branch or deploy without asking (same rule as `CLAUDE.md`).
- Don't ship the SQLite files, test databases, screenshots, Figma references or internal docs in the zip.
- Don't use AI-generated images in the zip.

---

## 4. Kickoff prompt for Claude Code (paste into the Cursor terminal, after the plan file is in docs/)

```
Read docs/themeforest-plan.md first, then CLAUDE.md, docs/context.md and docs/decision-log.md.
This folder is the ThemeForest copy of the Cosmia storefront. The original at
C:\Projects\beauty-ecommerce must never be modified. Remote: origin = AlveeUX/tf-beauty-ecommerce
(treat it as private; ask before every push).
Do NOT start P7. Start TF1 only:
1. Log decisions TF-D1..TF-D7 from the plan as the next D-numbers in docs/decision-log.md.
2. Write the TF1 task contract (development-plan.md section 3 format) and show it to me
   before coding.
3. After I approve: do TF1-T00 (baseline without compiling native code, option (a) first), then
   create the `themeforest` branch and do TF1-T02..T10 one task at a time, running typecheck, lint,
   Vitest and Playwright after each, and commit locally after each passing task.
Stop at the TF1 exit gate and report evidence.
```

**Right now, before the kickoff:** make the GitHub repo private (TF0-T05).
